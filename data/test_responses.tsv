1	#	Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
1	#	What's the difference?
1	#	I don't wanna use your car.
1	#	Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
1	#	So what would you do? You'd hitch?
1	#	I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
1	#	Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
1	#	You're not paying for it.
1	#	God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
2	#	...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
2	#	We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
2	#	I was telling you about Noel.
2	#	What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
2	#	No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
2	#	How do I get the hand?
2	#	She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
2	#	Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
2	#	With all due respect, I don't think so...
2	#	What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
3	#	I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
3	#	*No*, we would have heard it.
3	#	Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...
3	#	Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
3	#	We did. We're just hanging out.
3	#	Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
3	#	Have you thought about an intervention?
3	#	You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
3	#	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!
3	#	I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
4	#	Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!
4	#	The *beach*!
4	#	I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
4	#	Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
4	#	Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
4	#	Can I get in on that?
4	#	Is Elaine going?
4	#	Well, I knew him as well as she did.
4	#	So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
4	#	You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
