## Seinfeld Fan Site

### Overview

Seinfeld fan site where visitors can interact via bot with one of four characters from the show. Features a countdown to Festivus - December 23rd!

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- List any APIs or data sources you're planning on using here

### Data

- MVP: Bot details: Which character is “speaking” and their responses. 
- Extras if made: SeinFood: Food categories searched for, zip codes, and search results. 

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- Interactive bot. Choose from 4 characters to chat with. Say anything you want and receive a response (quote from the show).

- Festivus countdown. Festivus is a secular holiday as an alternative to the pressures and commercialism of the Christmas season, celebrated every year on December 23rd. Get ready.

#### 2.0

- Random video clips. Any Seinfeld fan will have no problem watching any scene, any time. Autoplay in full-screen random Seinfeld video clips from YouTube.

- Where are they now? Links to cast members’ Twitter accounts to see their most recent posts. Also features Modern Seinfeld, a fan account describing what would have been episodes made in today’s era (2010-2012). 

#### 3.0

- SeinFood locator. Pop in your zip code to see a list of places that serve food mentioned on the show!
