1	#	What do you think the worst part of being blind is?
1	#	You know, if you were blind, what do you think the worst part of it would be?
1	#	I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food. How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.
1	#	You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania?
1	#	He was at a carnival with his mother. She goes to get a hot dog, next thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.
1	#	Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that. (she starts the quick hand chops on his back) And these people are all over the place. You never know who's crazy, I could be one of these people.
1	#	Who takes care of your boy during the day?
1	#	No no. I'm just saying.
1	#	Oh I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable. I'm talking about the ones that forge `em.
1	#	(about the massage)You know I think this is really helping.
1	#	So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.
1	#	Neither do I, but I do it for them. I figure they're bored.
1	#	I'm in the middle of a story.
1	#	Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
1	#	Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
1	#	Yes, it was.
1	#	I know it was stupid.
1	#	Hey, I just said it was stupid.
1	#	Take it.
1	#	Hey, would you stop it already?
1	#	I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
1	#	Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Not if you have a doctor's note.
1	#	Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.
1	#	I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little off.
1	#	No appointments at all? Because my neck is still tight. What about Thursday? And Friday? Oh boy. Okay, thanks anyway.
1	#	What's with you?
1	#	Yes, A...?
1	#	Yes, a man gave you...?
1	#	So?
1	#	He was what?!
1	#	That's a massage.
1	#	You took your pants off?
1	#	Oh.
1	#	Really?
1	#	Moved?
1	#	I'm sure it didn't move.
1	#	Maybe it just wanted to change positions? You know, shift to the other side.
1	#	Okay, so what if it moved?
1	#	That's not the test. Contact is the test, if it moves, as a result of contact.
1	#	That's what a gym teacher once told me.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Joe DiMaggio? In Dinky Donuts?
1	#	No, I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut, he goes to a fancy restaurant or a hotel. He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.
1	#	I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly Dinky Donuts.
1	#	He can have a donut,
1	#	but not at Dinky.
1	#	I never said I'd do that.
1	#	I don't know how I feel about it.
1	#	Alright, alright.
1	#	...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.
1	#	I mean, if you feel funny about it, at all.
1	#	If he does.
1	#	He feels funny. You don't have to do this.
1	#	Roy, should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship?
1	#	What is the matter with you?
1	#	You don't have to, really.
1	#	We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George? (turns to George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster) George?
1	#	Well what about the week after?
1	#	No appointments at all? (motions to Elaine to move over)
1	#	Can I - can I at least just talk to her so I can apologize? Forget it. (Hangs up) I can't believe this, I make one innocent comment, about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off. This woman is insane. (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?
1	#	Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.
1	#	Uh huh.
1	#	See, now I know it's not him. Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.
1	#	What happened to you?
1	#	Hello? Oh, hi Roy. What? Oh my god. Wel-- how did this happen? What can I do? Oh. I am so sorry. Okay. Bye. (Hangs up) That was Roy. He's under investigation for insurance fraud.
1	#	I told you.
1	#	I told you we shouldn't do it.
1	#	He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license. You should have heard him. Three notes, how stupid was that? We never should have got three notes.
1	#	Yeah, you, me and George.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	You what?
1	#	Why'd you do that?
1	#	Of course I was getting you a note.
1	#	Neither did you, that's how he got caught. We sent in four notes from two doctors.
1	#	Hi Pam.
1	#	I just thought ahh maybe I could talk to Roy, if um
1	#	Hi Roy.
1	#	I don't even know what to say.
1	#	I knew this would happen.
1	#	I mean the whole thing, it's just...
1	#	Well it's not tragic.
1	#	No, it's...
1	#	Okay. I mean, what if the--
1	#	I'm not happy.
1	#	I mean I'm happy sometimes, but-but not now.
1	#	Yeah, college was fun.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Oh please, I love her.
1	#	Well what's the next move, what's gonna happen now?
1	#	What? The physical therapist? Why?
1	#	Hi. Ah look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.
1	#	Yeah, I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.
1	#	You don't understand, ah
1	#	Wait a second, don't you--
1	#	Hi. Hi. Look, I don't know what you think --
1	#	--but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is inadvertently sent an insurance--
1	#	Can't you just listen to me?
1	#	The police?
1	#	Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.
1	#	Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention, Elaine laughs) Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.
1	#	Did he say anything?
1	#	Having a cup of coffee.
1	#	Wow. Look at him. The Yankee Clipper
1	#	here.
1	#	What causes homophobia? What is it, that makes a heterosexual man, worry? I think it's because, men know, that deep down we have weak sales resistance. We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right. Men think, "Obviously I can be talked into anything. What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how you feel. No obligation, no pressure, just try it. Would you like to see him in a sandal?'"
1	#	Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off too that's the other thing ...
1	#	These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.
1	#	I don't blame you. I blame myself.
1	#	OK, I blame you.
1	#	What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.
1	#	I find the whole thing very embarrassing.
1	#	Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.
1	#	Hi
1	#	Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny.
1	#	Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.
1	#	Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very boring.
1	#	Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.
1	#	Volcano? Really?
1	#	Something to drink?
1	#	You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans
1	#	Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.
1	#	No, that's Krama.
1	#	It's all taken care of.
1	#	An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
1	#	I don't know. It must be love.
1	#	... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him with my bare hands
1	#	Have you ever been through an audit?
1	#	It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the flesh right off his bones ...
1	#	Yeah
1	#	Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor
1	#	And there's so much more to go.
1	#	So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?
1	#	What happened you didn't give her the papers?
1	#	SO?
1	#	You what?
1	#	I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?
1	#	Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump them.
1	#	How is that possible?
1	#	Oh, my God.
1	#	It's unheard of ...
1	#	So you lie! What did you tell her?
1	#	Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they want
1	#	OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?
1	#	Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?
1	#	Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
1	#	What? What?
1	#	This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.
1	#	Not good.
1	#	Not good
1	#	I can see that. What's it for?
1	#	Yeah (to buzzer)
1	#	Come on up.
1	#	wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's in front of the couch?
1	#	What's with you two?
1	#	Tell me what?
1	#	Completely naked?
1	#	OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.
1	#	You'll sense it.
1	#	Well, what happened? Was she there?
1	#	You didn't get my papers?
1	#	Well, where is she?
1	#	Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments which people like to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good (pulling at lapels, pockets etc.) feeling good looking good But when you're naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. (no movements) There's nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, (tugging and lifting belt) I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be, wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this (hand in pocket) I think that would really help a lot.
1	#	A mental institution?
1	#	You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!
1	#	So what now?
1	#	Can we go out there?
1	#	Woodhaven.
1	#	My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin' "where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"
1	#	That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.
1	#	Tuberculosis
1	#	Leroy
1	#	Tuberculosis
1	#	Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things about you from George.
1	#	Just chatting. Friendly.
1	#	It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places, what do you bring your pocketbook?
1	#	He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket books. Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.
1	#	there are no copies.
1	#	Who makes copies?
1	#	(on phone)Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer that I bought there.... it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.
1	#	Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.
1	#	George?
1	#	You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
1	#	I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know. But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake drums and just kinda crank it around there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you. Jail!"
1	#	I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."
1	#	Hey, there's the old man! (hug)
1	#	Ahh, we waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
1	#	What's the difference?
1	#	I don't wanna use your car.
1	#	Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
1	#	So what would you do? You'd hitch?
1	#	I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
1	#	Oh, I didn't get the insurance.
1	#	You're not paying for it.
1	#	God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
1	#	It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
1	#	(ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.
1	#	The lake isn't real.
1	#	I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
1	#	Ma.
1	#	(to Morty) What about you?
1	#	(to Helen) What about him?
1	#	Na, that's not such a good idea.
1	#	Not now. She's right inside.
1	#	I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
1	#	Well...
1	#	Shh! Nothing, nothing.
1	#	(tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggage, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangements, but we can't seem to be friends when we sleep together.
1	#	I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
1	#	I'm going for the record.
1	#	Oh, come on.
1	#	Nice to see you. This is Elaine.
1	#	We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
1	#	For fun.
1	#	I don't think so.
1	#	What kind of pen is that?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?
1	#	Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen work.
1	#	Oh no.
1	#	I couldn't
1	#	I can't take it.
1	#	No, I'm not...
1	#	I cannot take it!
1	#	Are you sure?
1	#	O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!
1	#	Thanks again.
1	#	What he gave it to me.
1	#	He offered it to me.
1	#	I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
1	#	He could have said "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.
1	#	If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.
1	#	Well, he was wrong.
1	#	So you want me to return it?
1	#	Hey I don't even want the pen now!
1	#	Are you O.K. in here?
1	#	It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.
1	#	Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.
1	#	Oh, no don't say that. You'll jinx me.
1	#	They're nuts with temperature.
1	#	How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
1	#	It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
1	#	Stay on Biscayne.
1	#	Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
1	#	What's so special up here?
1	#	Then YOU would be hunched over.
1	#	You can't go?
1	#	Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
1	#	You sure?
1	#	We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
1	#	Why don't you get a new sofa?
1	#	I'm buying you a new sofa.
1	#	Hi. How are you?
1	#	Evelyn, this is Elaine.
1	#	Too thin?
1	#	(Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?
1	#	I never really wanted the pen.
1	#	No, no, I...
1	#	All I said was "I like the pen".
1	#	Don't be alarmed.
1	#	I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
1	#	(to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
1	#	Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
1	#	Well I started to go under...
1	#	Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.
1	#	I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
1	#	Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.
1	#	I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he hands the pen to Jack)
1	#	Take it.
1	#	What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?
1	#	Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
1	#	Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
1	#	(Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
1	#	Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)
1	#	(to Leo) Uncle Leo.
1	#	I've got a black eye.
1	#	Oh uh, Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.
1	#	(to Stella) Her back hurts.
1	#	No, no.
1	#	Dad!
1	#	(in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.
1	#	(to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)
1	#	(still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?
1	#	Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?
1	#	All I said was I liked the pen!
1	#	There must be some mistake.
1	#	(to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...
1	#	Nothing.
1	#	Hi Evelyn.
1	#	Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)
1	#	Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."
1	#	So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it some gas! We're flying!
1	#	Is he on the plane now?
1	#	Uh, just my next door neighbor.
1	#	Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?
1	#	What's the matter?
1	#	Huh? How you feeling?
1	#	Farfel?
1	#	The dog? The dog??
1	#	But, you know, what if, you know?
1	#	The dog?
1	#	Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?
1	#	Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of the house since I got back.
1	#	Do I what?
1	#	Yes, I pick it up.
1	#	Well you have to.
1	#	SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?
1	#	No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.
1	#	I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.
1	#	I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.
1	#	Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!
1	#	Why?
1	#	You're breaking up?
1	#	I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
1	#	Well you can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after they stop seeing them.
1	#	You. I'm talking about people.
1	#	No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.
1	#	Sure.
1	#	What do you need me for?
1	#	No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!
1	#	I can't go.
1	#	Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
1	#	He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
1	#	No, I don't want that smell in the house.
1	#	No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of strange mutant funk.
1	#	Nah. You two go.
1	#	Go ahead.
1	#	I want to but I can't.
1	#	No.
1	#	Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.
1	#	Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
1	#	On my block, a lot of ah, people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
1	#	Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
1	#	That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're checking out!
1	#	Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.
1	#	Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on down. (To Elaine) What?
1	#	What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not sure this is a dog.
1	#	I'm in the book and I have a machine.
1	#	Really? How late are they open?
1	#	What?
1	#	Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.
1	#	Well I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.
1	#	What are you doing?
1	#	Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
1	#	I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said anything,
1	#	Well.
1	#	everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) Yeah?
1	#	Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.
1	#	It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.
1	#	I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?
1	#	Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De Leon.
1	#	She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
1	#	I don't know, regular human time?
1	#	Why shouldn't I go here?
1	#	Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!
1	#	So what are calling me six times a day?
1	#	I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
1	#	It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?
1	#	Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
1	#	I don't know what to do.
1	#	I know, I know.
1	#	It is kind of silly.
1	#	I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.
1	#	It's not like she's *in* the movie.
1	#	Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.
1	#	How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon, let's just go.
1	#	Saving movies.
1	#	Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in big trouble.
1	#	You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said you were released on Monday.
1	#	Oh, hi Ellen.
1	#	Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week, but if you don't mind...
1	#	Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
1	#	Why don't we just rent a movie?
1	#	No, it&Mac226;s, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long, there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard. i...
1	#	Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.
1	#	You and George got together?
1	#	Hello.
1	#	What's up?
1	#	About what?
1	#	Too bad.
1	#	Prognosis Negative.
1	#	It's not.
1	#	I have an instinct for these things.
1	#	I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed. We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?
1	#	Does it seem to you that the ventriloquist dummy has a very active sexual social life? he's always talking about dates and women that he knows and bringing them back to the suitcase at night, there's always a sawdust joke in there somewhere you know, kinky things cuz he's made out of wood an' he can spin his head around, we're somehow expected to believe because the face is soo animated that they think we aren't noticing that the feet are just swinging there, dummy feet never look right do they? they're just kinda dangling there, always kinda askew you know? you always see just little ankle, those thin fabric ankles that they have you know. Ya think 'I don't think this thing is real.'
1	#	Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?
1	#	Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour. Bye.
1	#	This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer in 1971 and never returned it.
1	#	It doesn't work like that.
1	#	It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly because I was with Sherry Becker. She wore this orange dress. It was the first time I ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...
1	#	That orange dress is burned in my memory
1	#	I wonder what ever happened to her.
1	#	Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is completely ridiculous.
1	#	It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
1	#	(to speaker) Coming down.
1	#	I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
1	#	Where's George
1	#	I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them in my house.
1	#	This woman's completely ignoring me.
1	#	Eventually a little shot of penicillin
1	#	Yeah I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
1	#	Can I speak with this Bookman?
1	#	What?
1	#	Who?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	(whispers) Haymen, Are you sure?
1	#	George got him fired. He squealed on him.
1	#	Oh, he sang like a canary.
1	#	Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
1	#	Well what am I supposed to do now?
1	#	All right Thanks. Come on lets go
1	#	So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
1	#	I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps were hangin' down by his ,...
1	#	I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.
1	#	Echh
1	#	He got fired the next day.
1	#	They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the waistband on top of the head. Very rare.
1	#	Well what do girls do ?
1	#	What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done. It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late. ... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?
1	#	Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would you like a cup of tea?
1	#	Coffee?
1	#	No, I don't drink coffee.
1	#	No, I don't have--
1	#	Well, I don't normally--
1	#	I don't.
1	#	Really? I'll have to remember that.
1	#	Yes, and I returned it in 1971.
1	#	Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very specifically.
1	#	I try.
1	#	No, I don't.
1	#	Certainly not.
1	#	No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book in 1971. I have a witness Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum. It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it. (thinks out loud, opens phone book) Becker, ... Becker, ...
1	#	So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?
1	#	Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?
1	#	No Black Jack?
1	#	Tropic of Cancer.
1	#	Tropic of Capricorn?
1	#	Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.
1	#	George, here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
1	#	Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.
1	#	It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go. (to old man that enters) It was GEORGE!
1	#	Maybe you're getting' a raise.
1	#	Wait 'til I tell him about the book.
1	#	I'm right here.
1	#	Columbus, Euro trash.
1	#	That was double overtime.
1	#	So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER
1	#	Because I gave it to you.
1	#	Yeah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.
1	#	Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.
1	#	All right, I'll see you after school. I,,m late for Hayman's hygiene.
1	#	Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.
1	#	What is your problem?
1	#	(after Bookman exits) That is one tough monkey! (turns to Elaine) So you were saying?
1	#	Oh, beautiful did he like them?
1	#	(to George) Was he out there?
1	#	I guess we'll never know.
1	#	Any day that you had gym it was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History, Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.
1	#	Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons?
1	#	No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner.
1	#	Big accomplishment.
1	#	Five o'clock.
1	#	You're not late.
1	#	Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour.
1	#	There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time.
1	#	You got the picnic and burger traffic.
1	#	I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls?
1	#	(CONT'D) You want me to help you with that?
1	#	(TO GEORGE, REWOMAN) What do you think, Georgie boy?
1	#	I thought it was green. I remember seeing green.
1	#	It's over there. I know where it is.
1	#	There it is!...No, no that's a Toyota.
1	#	(CONT'D) Hmmm...I thought it was...
1	#	I thought it was over there.
1	#	I really have to go to the bathroom.
1	#	I'll wait.
1	#	Alright.
1	#	Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character.
1	#	(TO KRAMER, REBOX) Will you let me help you with that?
1	#	You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it?
1	#	Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket."
1	#	Maybe it's not on this level.
1	#	There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up?
1	#	You should always carry a pad and pen.
1	#	Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms."
1	#	All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay?
1	#	His eyes look a little cloudy.
1	#	Who's got the tickets? GEORGE I do. (TO KRAMER) I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before!
1	#	No one's going to do that.
1	#	Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those?
1	#	It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in.
1	#	I know.
1	#	No I can't.
1	#	You think I'm too cautious?
1	#	Organic. So's Buddy Hackett.
1	#	He's a comedian.
1	#	All right. All right.
1	#	I can manage.
1	#	Okay, okay. I'll be right back.
1	#	But...
1	#	(STARTS TO LEAVE, TO HIMSELF) ...Kramer
1	#	I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die.
1	#	Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for?
1	#	So you don't care if I die.
1	#	It was life and death.
1	#	Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
1	#	Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
1	#	(C0NT'D) Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck.
1	#	First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know.
1	#	Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
1	#	(CONT'D) And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is.
1	#	You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle.
1	#	(A NEW TACK) All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen.
1	#	(CONT'D) What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years.
1	#	(TO GEORGE) Was he also in a Red Chinese prison?
1	#	Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? GEORGE Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy.
1	#	Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook.
1	#	I was arrested for urinating.
1	#	I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know.
1	#	No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR)
1	#	Hey, where's Kramer?
1	#	Where's Kramer?
1	#	Hey George, there she is again. ...
1	#	Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening.
1	#	Filthy pigs.
1	#	Jerry.
1	#	Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive.
1	#	The car!
1	#	Kramer!
1	#	Kramer.
1	#	Yeah, over here.
1	#	This is amazing, I haven't seen one person go in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.
1	#	What's that smell? What are you wearing?
1	#	Manly.
1	#	So why didn't you say no?
1	#	Look at this poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan -- they're waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.
1	#	That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.
1	#	I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.
1	#	All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.
1	#	Who thinks you're smart?
1	#	What thing?
1	#	Oh, Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.
1	#	What'd ya get?
1	#	What do you say?
1	#	1409, that's a good score.
1	#	What did you really get?
1	#	Of course.
1	#	I hope so.
1	#	He's serving Mexican, Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one's going in.
1	#	I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for survival. And even though ya know he's not going to make it, y-y-you kind of root for him for a second.
1	#	Well, it's a spider.
1	#	Bazooka Joe.
1	#	The buzzer.
1	#	My house? You gotta be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah? (to the intercom)
1	#	Come on up.
1	#	What's that?
1	#	Come on, Go in, go in! [watching Dream Cafe with binoculars again]
1	#	No, I'm afraid we'll start talking, and I'll gonna wind up going partners with him.
1	#	You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.
1	#	Casus belli.
1	#	Hey, how'd you do on that IQ test?
1	#	Oh, it's nothing...
1	#	Why must you always be the focal point of attention? Why can't you just be? (Elaine laughs - hu) Why can't you live?
1	#	This woman he's dating is making him take this IQ test for this course.
1	#	No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.
1	#	You know, I don't even know my IQ.
1	#	Get out of here!
1	#	You get out of here!
1	#	Boy that'd be something, cheating on a IQ test.
1	#	Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that. (stepping over Elaine then George's legs to get to the large blue chair and sits down.)
1	#	Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.
1	#	Hey, I love a good caper.
1	#	Well, ah, I've been looking forward to it.
1	#	Eh, people, people are talking.
1	#	Ah, non-smoking would be great.
1	#	Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]
1	#	Well, ah w-what do you recommend my good fellow?
1	#	Well then the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend. I'm sure you flourish at this location for many, many years.
1	#	(thinks) Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people the way I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a Nobel Prize?
1	#	Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.
1	#	Oh, please...
1	#	Eat something! Babu...
1	#	Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	So?
1	#	Why not?
1	#	Statute.
1	#	Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.
1	#	Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.
1	#	Oh my God.
1	#	Go ahead, I'll take care of it.
1	#	It's all right, she was cheating anyway.
1	#	Babu, you're Pakistani, right?
1	#	Babu, may I say something?
1	#	I am not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to say t-the franks and beans for example.
1	#	Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.
1	#	Well, you know; not everything. I do what I can.
1	#	The average person in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.
1	#	Of course, I always do.
1	#	Hey Georgie!
1	#	How'd you do on the IQ test?!
1	#	What?!!
1	#	Well, well, well...
1	#	Well, I'm no genius but, according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.
1	#	Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions on hunting and testicles...
1	#	But an 85?
1	#	Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.
1	#	Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I'm sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.
1	#	I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.
1	#	Let me tell you something Babu. You go back in that kitchen -- tell your chef I want the works.
1	#	Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just, it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?
1	#	Well, maybe your refrigerator...
1	#	No I...
1	#	Well I...
1	#	You know, I think I'll just take the check.
1	#	(thinking) Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?
1	#	You know what it was, bad location.
1	#	Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?
1	#	Oh, sorry.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	151?
1	#	So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?
1	#	You know, what would be great?
1	#	....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant? Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost the Zest." ....rejects the transplant with organs. Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly... ..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.
1	#	Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )
1	#	Oh! well whatever you have to do.
1	#	(sarcastically) No you don't..
1	#	My show from last night.
1	#	Yeah , I was doing new material.
1	#	Huh?
1	#	The" coup d-toe"
1	#	Yeah!
1	#	Nothin'.....nothing at all.
1	#	Who you calling?
1	#	China really?
1	#	What for?
1	#	Hair?
1	#	Done what?
1	#	(to Kramer) What's this?
1	#	Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.
1	#	Oh! my God!....
1	#	Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to me on my tape recorder while I was on stage. This is wild. I've never heard anything like this in my life. Listen to this.
1	#	I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.
1	#	It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.
1	#	Good question.
1	#	If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.
1	#	Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.
1	#	(pushes George) NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!!
1	#	The Chinese , the Chinese bald cure.
1	#	No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.
1	#	Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf. (leaves table)
1	#	Remember Peter?
1	#	You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.
1	#	Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?
1	#	She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults. Things you would know very little about.
1	#	Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.
1	#	No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.
1	#	Sure.
1	#	I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.
1	#	Why are you doing this?
1	#	Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?
1	#	You know what that makes you?...A baldist.
1	#	Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed that she had the anger and intensity that I needed to make this film work.
1	#	(as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me (Ping looks up) Kind of an expensive call.
1	#	..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye. HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...
1	#	That's my cockney accent.
1	#	Lets hear yours.
1	#	That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I got.
1	#	Oh! Is that the bald stuff?
1	#	Yes I am skeptical.
1	#	Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....
1	#	Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	No kidding?
1	#	What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?
1	#	You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?
1	#	How long are you suppose to leave it on for?
1	#	Hello.
1	#	Well Hello..
1	#	Yes , I got her number.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business
1	#	What? I dunno.
1	#	I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.
1	#	She's coming up.
1	#	Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)
1	#	I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.
1	#	The big toe; The captain.
1	#	The captain of the toes. (phone rings) Hello.
1	#	Okay....too bad.
1	#	Soon as I get off the phone wih you.
1	#	okay , bye (to George) What happened , did you take it off?
1	#	That's it, you gave up?
1	#	That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.
1	#	Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.
1	#	This is Jerry Seinfeld.
1	#	(to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in my life. I get the Pull Back.
1	#	Yeah..
1	#	Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?
1	#	She must be psychotic or something.
1	#	I'm not giving you her number.
1	#	Sheriff?........What's with the hat?
1	#	What are doing here now?
1	#	What's up?
1	#	So just start it.
1	#	Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there. C'mon so what is this about?
1	#	Kramer, let's do this later.
1	#	Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.
1	#	It's kinda private.
1	#	I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!
1	#	Does she know?
1	#	How did it happen?
1	#	Well, why can't you say it?
1	#	I thought you just said she doesn't know??
1	#	So how can you promise her?
1	#	What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?
1	#	What, Elaine?
1	#	(picks up the headphones) That was Elaine...
1	#	Wait a second. .Just give me a second
1	#	She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence
1	#	Yeaaaah!!!
1	#	Okay, Okay, I promise. (puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God.. Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa (Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)
1	#	Oooh! I got a pain in my side.
1	#	What are you doing here?
1	#	I know, George told me.
1	#	Where did you come up with all that stuff?
1	#	George NO!!
1	#	George I'm telling ya..
1	#	Aye......
1	#	It's early.
1	#	I met her on an elevator.
1	#	Impossible, right?
1	#	I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The words just came out of my mouth.
1	#	You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.
1	#	Can you believe I did that?
1	#	Not a good sign.
1	#	You got something in your teeth there.
1	#	It's green.
1	#	Did you bump into anybody you knew?
1	#	How'd it go?
1	#	What do you need a job, you got Audrey.
1	#	What's the matter?
1	#	What?
1	#	Too late for that.
1	#	Yeah, she's got a big nose.
1	#	It's a schnoz.
1	#	A little.
1	#	Stop being so concerned with looks.
1	#	Have you said anything to her about it?
1	#	Alright, shut up, here they come.
1	#	Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.
1	#	We have time.
1	#	It is exciting.
1	#	Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.
1	#	Then what?
1	#	She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless, I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.
1	#	(holding up a piece of paper) I don't want to see this woman anymore but I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help me.
1	#	So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.
1	#	I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was just completely uninhibited.
1	#	It's not like that at all.
1	#	Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.
1	#	Shouldn't a doctor do it?
1	#	Great job.
1	#	Let's put him over here.
1	#	Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!
1	#	You're lying! You got it, I want that number!
1	#	Give it to me!
1	#	Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.
1	#	I was lying, give it to me!
1	#	I want that number!
1	#	I'm Nelson!
1	#	Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just need more time.
1	#	Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.
1	#	(to himself Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
1	#	Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.
1	#	So I assume the jig was up.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	How did you get fleas?
1	#	Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.
1	#	I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation. The whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?"
1	#	Who?
1	#	Nah.
1	#	Oh, well, now you're talking.
1	#	What does that mean, good dip?
1	#	There's girls everywhere. I go out of my apartment, there's girls in the elevator. They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?
1	#	Got it.
1	#	I got isobutane-20.
1	#	You got sorbitant sesquioliate?
1	#	I have aloe!
1	#	Where do they make yours?
1	#	White Plains.
1	#	Girls. There's girls right here in the store. Look, look, there's one over there. Look, there's another one. Soon as I walk outside there'll be girls out there. What's the matter?
1	#	Are you sure? Oh boy, here we go.
1	#	No, let's survey first. Camp here.
1	#	What could possess anyone to throw a party? I mean, to have a bunch of strangers treat your house like a hotel room.
1	#	Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.
1	#	Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight. In case one of us gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so the other one can get us out of it.
1	#	Thirty-six. What's the signal? Howbout this? Chicken wing? No, no, no, I got a better one. Head patting.
1	#	Yeah, yeah I did.
1	#	(Patting his head I'm a comedian.
1	#	(still Patting) I hear a voice.
1	#	A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.
1	#	It's a nervous tic. I'm on L-Dopa.
1	#	Great, how about you?
1	#	How do you account for this?
1	#	Well, she obviously liked you all along.
1	#	Anyway, I'm ready to go.
1	#	If not now, when?
1	#	Okay, half-hour.
1	#	(interrupting) Can I talk to you for a second?
1	#	Hey, I was dying over there.
1	#	Right.
1	#	You ready?
1	#	I do favors.
1	#	What?
1	#	Wow.
1	#	Go! What could you do?
1	#	We'll get a ride.
1	#	We'll be fine, what did she say?
1	#	What? She said that?
1	#	Get out of here.
1	#	What did you say?
1	#	What did you say?
1	#	What?
1	#	I long for you?
1	#	It's okay, that's not bad.
1	#	Really?
1	#	Oh, come on.
1	#	George, you're thinking too much.
1	#	(walking up) Pendant? Those bastards.
1	#	Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office
1	#	Uh, no, he's taking the car.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.
1	#	There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.
1	#	Yeah, yeah, alright.
1	#	Just don't make a scene.
1	#	Oh boy.
1	#	Here we go.
1	#	You're beautiful.
1	#	Alright. (Approaches host) Excuse me, this is your party, right?
1	#	Can I use your phone?
1	#	A bigger bill?
1	#	Krame? Sein. What are you doing? Well, I'm stuck out here on Long Island. What are your thoughts about taking a ride? You sure? Okay, but don't leave me hanging here. Okay, great. Let me give you directions.
1	#	I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
1	#	I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.
1	#	(noticing a coffee table book) Oh, you got the Civil War book. I saw some of that show, it was wonderful.
1	#	Thousand.
1	#	Yes. (To Jenny) You're sure there's nothing we can do?
1	#	You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here. Mike Wichter. He sold plastic straws. You know the ones? You could bend them.
1	#	Oh, he's coming.
1	#	That's him.
1	#	Thanks, great party.
1	#	Hey, it's okay.
1	#	Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you one.
1	#	And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy club, whatever.
1	#	(writing) Here's my address and number. And really, thanks again.
1	#	George, I've been sick all week. Elaine was too. Eighty miles an hour, forty degree temperature for fifty minutes. Do the math. Yeah, maybe I will get out. Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first. Okay, meet me down there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something. Yeah, Selwyn's. Okay bye.
1	#	Who is it?
1	#	Who?
1	#	Do I know you?
1	#	I'm sorry, uh-
1	#	Oh, okay.
1	#	You certainly are. What's going on?
1	#	Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
1	#	No, really, I just got off the phone with him.
1	#	Look, you can hang out here if you want.
1	#	No, it's-
1	#	No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.
1	#	Really, I'm sorry. Maybe another time.
1	#	They guy's in my house right now. What a mistake that party was, I never should have gone.
1	#	Oh, come on.
1	#	I've never had a job.
1	#	That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?
1	#	What are you gonna do?
1	#	Alright, I'm gonna get this. This looks good.
1	#	Nine sixty.
1	#	Why?
1	#	What do you mean, you got it?
1	#	Since when are you treating me to medicine? What are you doing? You're stealing this, aren't you?
1	#	You're a lunatic.
1	#	What do you say to a person like you?
1	#	Oh.
1	#	Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?
1	#	What the hell?
1	#	Nice to meet you.
1	#	What the hell is going on here?
1	#	Oh, Kramer huh?
1	#	Patti?
1	#	Alright, how much does he owe you?
1	#	(taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly) Fifty dollars.
1	#	Yeah, but--
1	#	Wait a second, I--
1	#	He was a nice guy.
1	#	Was there a red-headed guy there?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah, I know. There's no call for that kind of attitude.
1	#	Oh, we all hated him.
1	#	Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.
1	#	I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not tuned in to it like it's my son.
1	#	They cross the wires or something.
1	#	They stole my car.
1	#	They did.
1	#	What should I do, should I call the police?
1	#	I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.
1	#	Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.
1	#	Are you serious?
1	#	I don't even know if I remember the number.
1	#	What do I say if he picks up?
1	#	Hello? Is this 555-8383?
1	#	Can I ask you a question?
1	#	Did you steal my car?
1	#	You did?!
1	#	That's my car!
1	#	What are you gonna do with it?
1	#	Then can I have it back?
1	#	(derisively at Kramer) Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?
1	#	Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?
1	#	Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.
1	#	Sid left the keys in the car.
1	#	He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.
1	#	He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get a ticket.
1	#	Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.
1	#	The whole block, forty, fifty cars.
1	#	Hey Sid, what happened?
1	#	You left the keys in the car?
1	#	Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.
1	#	This Wednesday?
1	#	But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.
1	#	Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all the way over. You're welcome.
1	#	Owen March, I never heard of him.
1	#	Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.
1	#	What's that?
1	#	Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm kidding around, of course.
1	#	Sixty-six years old?
1	#	Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?
1	#	Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant, she'd be spinning.
1	#	I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?
1	#	But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the reservation.
1	#	I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.
1	#	Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?
1	#	Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.
1	#	Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought I was checking with you.
1	#	Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.
1	#	Fine.
1	#	Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car.
1	#	Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.
1	#	Well that's what's important.
1	#	How many times you been out with him?
1	#	Face to face.
1	#	If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.
1	#	What is going on out there?
1	#	So then what?
1	#	That's great!
1	#	You mean *a* career.
1	#	No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
1	#	Oh my god.
1	#	Boy, he took it hard.
1	#	(on the phone) Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.
1	#	(To Elaine) It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's unconscious.
1	#	Kramer.
1	#	Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?
1	#	You raise the feet, get blood to the head.
1	#	I don't have a washcloth.
1	#	You can't put a paper towel on his head.
1	#	How you gonna hold it on there?
1	#	Should we walk him around?
1	#	No, no that's for a drug overdose.
1	#	Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie or something.
1	#	We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.
1	#	Cookies don't liquefy.
1	#	What blender? I don't have a blender.
1	#	I would know if I had a blender.
1	#	(on phone) Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five minutes ago.
1	#	This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes) Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?
1	#	Come on up. Okay, they're here.
1	#	Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.
1	#	Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?
1	#	Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.
1	#	Yeah, that's true.
1	#	Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.
1	#	I could tell.
1	#	Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!
1	#	What happened to the car?
1	#	We don't know!
1	#	So how'd you hit the car?
1	#	It's not even my car, it's a rental.
1	#	Can I get anybody anything?
1	#	Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.
1	#	(reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.
1	#	(continuing) The extent of the damage would have been far less severe had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.
1	#	(finishing) The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in New York were over.
1	#	Can he communicate?
1	#	Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before, uh, my car got smashed.
1	#	What community? There's a community?
1	#	All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.
1	#	Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...
1	#	That is right, somebody else was driving.
1	#	Uh huh, what's that?
1	#	Other drivers?
1	#	Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car. That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or something?
1	#	Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.
1	#	Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of Independence, who's gonna read that?
1	#	These pretzels are making me thirsty.
1	#	An overdose of odor? Good question.
1	#	Ahh.
1	#	Let me get that.
1	#	Please.
1	#	(sarcastically) Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.
1	#	What are you doing here?
1	#	Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.
1	#	I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?
1	#	Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.
1	#	Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?
1	#	I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?
1	#	It was a gift.
1	#	If they like each other.
1	#	See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
1	#	Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.
1	#	You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
1	#	Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
1	#	I think it's off the wagon.
1	#	What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
1	#	Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.
1	#	Under the sofa cushion.
1	#	It's your Christmas present.
1	#	"The guy?"
1	#	Cranberry juice?
1	#	So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
1	#	Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.
1	#	There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?
1	#	Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.
1	#	I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.
1	#	I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.
1	#	Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?
1	#	Yeah. She would love cashmere.
1	#	Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
1	#	Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)
1	#	It's hard to say.
1	#	Well I can see it.
1	#	Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
1	#	It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
1	#	You want me to take an overview?
1	#	I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.
1	#	Yeah so?
1	#	Oh boy, can you smell it?
1	#	Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
1	#	Yes you do.
1	#	Yes you would.
1	#	I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?
1	#	Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
1	#	I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.
1	#	I don't smell anything.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Come on up.
1	#	Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
1	#	I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.
1	#	(uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Ahem. Say that again?
1	#	Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
1	#	Now what did you ask me again.
1	#	You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?
1	#	Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.
1	#	It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
1	#	Convulsing?
1	#	I don't know, I'm trying to help you.
1	#	You don't drink.
1	#	So you started drinking.
1	#	So how was it?
1	#	Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
1	#	You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.
1	#	What are you saying?
1	#	You're saying something.
1	#	Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
1	#	Well why don't you say it?
1	#	What did you say?
1	#	Yeah?
1	#	Come on up.
1	#	No I didn't.
1	#	I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.
1	#	Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.
1	#	Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.
1	#	No.
1	#	I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
1	#	No.
1	#	I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
1	#	I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.
1	#	Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.
1	#	In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?
1	#	On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?
1	#	They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
1	#	I know enough not to get on them.
1	#	George?
1	#	George?
1	#	I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
1	#	I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
1	#	Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
1	#	Get off of me.
1	#	But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.
1	#	Don't get smart.
1	#	Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.
1	#	That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview, in 'Death of a salesman'.
1	#	What time is the lesbian wedding?
1	#	I'm so tired. I'll fall asleep on that train (yawns)
1	#	Oh, I'm paying for breakfast?
1	#	Why do I always pay? What am I made of money? You bunch of deadbeats.
1	#	So, can I convince anybody to come down to Coney Island with me? I got to pick up my car at the pound. George?
1	#	Not only that they found it. It was simonized and the front end was aligned.
1	#	So what do you say? Run in the cyclone. Hotdogs on Nathan's is on me.
1	#	All right, biff. Elaine, merry-go-round?
1	#	Kramer, bumper-cars?
1	#	Could be years before I get back to Coney Island. I can't go to rides alone.
1	#	O-K. You realize of course, you're naked?
1	#	You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
1	#	I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep knee bends, maybe a squat thrust?
1	#	All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're not a 'half-grapefruit and black coffee' guy.
1	#	I understand, I like good breakfast. Long as you don't wind up trapped in a room with bib overalls and pigtails, been counseled by Dick Gregory.
1	#	That's your problem, you should be.
1	#	Don't get up, please, allow me.
1	#	I'm not worried about their best pitching. They got pitching. ...They got no hitting.
1	#	Defence? Please. ...They need speed.
1	#	Franco's no good? ...They got no team leaders.
1	#	But you gotta like their chances.
1	#	Tell you what. If they win the penant I'll sit naked with you at the World Series.
1	#	First we ride the cyclone.
1	#	Aah, French fries.
1	#	No, I never got the car. We were having such a good time, by the time I got to the police garage, it was closed.
1	#	You wouldn't believe what this guy put away at Nathan's. Look at what we won!
1	#	You want him?
1	#	So, you missed the wedding. You'll catch the bris!
1	#	Biff, what did you whistle on the elevator?
1	#	Yeah, it's in the kitchen drawer.
1	#	Come on, I'll go with you.
1	#	Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.
1	#	Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...
1	#	All right, I'm sorry. What about her?
1	#	I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.
1	#	We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the hand right from the opening.
1	#	Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...
1	#	That smells good, what is that?
1	#	The *beach*?
1	#	You joined the *Polar Bears*?!
1	#	Yeah... So's shock therapy.
1	#	[with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!
1	#	You don't know?
1	#	You think they have fleas there, don't you?
1	#	Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you think they have fleas there.
1	#	They have a piano backstage they warm up on.
1	#	What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?
1	#	[quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's directed at *me*, isn't it?!
1	#	Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)
1	#	I dunno, it was an impulse.
1	#	How could I know she would start to laugh?
1	#	Can we just go in already?
1	#	What about?
1	#	I know, but I'm distracted now.
1	#	Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?
1	#	"Cut to the chase"?
1	#	What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?
1	#	I would lose that.
1	#	"Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!
1	#	Really, an intervention ...
1	#	Me? Why me?
1	#	Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
1	#	We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
1	#	You play a *Hell* of a piano.
1	#	Pez?
1	#	Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
1	#	Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
1	#	We'll be outside
1	#	It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?
1	#	You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.
1	#	A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.
1	#	What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, and a month later he was dead.
1	#	All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.
1	#	He's the same!
1	#	Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye. [to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?
1	#	Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.
1	#	What do you think? It's like a poker game?
1	#	Yeah
1	#	Yeah, but John invited her.
1	#	No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.
1	#	Stop smelling your arm.
1	#	Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."
1	#	Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein. In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.
1	#	She broke up with you?
1	#	What was on the list?
1	#	Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,
1	#	What's wrong with lunch?
1	#	A preemptive breakup.
1	#	In the freezer.
1	#	Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
1	#	Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Intervention.
1	#	No, we're having an intervention
1	#	There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.
1	#	It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
1	#	Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.
1	#	We're having the intervention for Richie.
1	#	Well, uh..
1	#	Well, you're looking well.
1	#	I didn't know she would laugh.
1	#	Hey Richie
1	#	It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's talking back.
1	#	So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table
1	#	He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and his father was trying to load one of them
1	#	Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.
1	#	So as he's telling the story he starts crying.
1	#	What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
1	#	Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday. He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.
1	#	I can't do those things.
1	#	Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?
1	#	What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?
1	#	I think Ill take out the garbage.
1	#	Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 900 oclock, that was pretty rough. (exits to hall with garbage  meets George) Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.
1	#	Come on, its just down the hall.
1	#	Ill give you 50 cents.
1	#	Come on. Fifty cents. (??) a piece of Drakes coffee cake
1	#	I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?
1	#	Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?
1	#	How much do they cost?
1	#	No, no the junior.
1	#	Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! (MARTIN enters the hall) How ya doing?
1	#	Boy shes sexy isnt she?
1	#	Do you believe that guy?
1	#	My neighbour
1	#	Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?
1	#	Whats so amazing? Youve seen him before.
1	#	What was the dream?
1	#	I think Ive played there.
1	#	Youre a little paranormal
1	#	Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?
1	#	Alright, come on, lets get out of here.
1	#	I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.
1	#	Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.
1	#	Who is it? Who is it?
1	#	Who?
1	#	Martine?
1	#	Oh, Martin!
1	#	What?
1	#	In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
1	#	Itll take two seconds.
1	#	We dont have two seconds?
1	#	Nah, forget it.
1	#	Nah. Ill just wear the pajamas.
1	#	Are you sure?
1	#	Nah, Ill go get the robe.
1	#	Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.
1	#	Really? Its over?
1	#	Oh boy, did he say anything about me?
1	#	He said that?
1	#	Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.
1	#	You werent?
1	#	Of course.
1	#	Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.
1	#	I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.
1	#	No, I just wanted to see what time it was.
1	#	No.
1	#	Here?
1	#	Is this the proper venue?
1	#	No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.
1	#	I cant. What if he wakes up?
1	#	A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  you dont want to mess with it.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Yeah, I heard.
1	#	Who told you about Martin?
1	#	Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?
1	#	You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?
1	#	Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.
1	#	So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.
1	#	Nothing.
1	#	I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.
1	#	So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.
1	#	So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?
1	#	You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.
1	#	No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.
1	#	Theyre a comedy team.
1	#	Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.
1	#	I will show you The Stooges.
1	#	Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.
1	#	Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.
1	#	Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
1	#	Yeah, all right. All right.
1	#	Hello Newman.
1	#	Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.
1	#	Boy, its a good thing we came.
1	#	George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.
1	#	Looters.
1	#	Shes really hungry.
1	#	Hello.
1	#	Hows he doing?
1	#	Why wouldnt he?
1	#	Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
1	#	How up to date?
1	#	And nothing could change your mind?
1	#	Drakes Coffee Cake
1	#	From my house. I got a whole box of them.
1	#	Thats your big boy.
1	#	I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving it for later.
1	#	I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.
1	#	You swear?
1	#	On your mothers life?
1	#	Elaine! No! No!
1	#	Hey!
1	#	What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
1	#	What did she name the kid?
1	#	Hey.
1	#	osh.
1	#	Woah. (hitting George)
1	#	Wow! (hitting George)
1	#	Oh! (hitting George)
1	#	Oh! (hitting George)
1	#	Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
1	#	Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.
1	#	Yeah, its some place down in the village.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	All right were coming down.
1	#	Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?
1	#	Oh, yes you will.
1	#	Yeah, maybe you won't.
1	#	Are my nostrils getting bigger?
1	#	Oh, so there's still hope.
1	#	Oh, so hopelessness is the key.
1	#	Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.
1	#	Went out with George, you?
1	#	How was it? What'd you talk about?
1	#	We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't find anybody.
1	#	George too.
1	#	I've never fixed anybody up.
1	#	Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for George?
1	#	Well you implied it.
1	#	Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong. Dead wrong. Who is she?
1	#	He's George!
1	#	So what?
1	#	I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?
1	#	I went out with you.
1	#	Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but George can bait a hook.
1	#	Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.
1	#	Yeah, come on, it's a good match.
1	#	Naturally.
1	#	Everything.
1	#	Why?
1	#	She's good looking.
1	#	Very good looking.
1	#	Really very good looking.
1	#	Yes, I would take her out.
1	#	What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!
1	#	I'm telling you, she's good looking.
1	#	Good body, nice body.
1	#	Nice.
1	#	Pretty nice.
1	#	Really very nice and good.
1	#	Good personality. Funny. Bright.
1	#	How could she be smarter than you?
1	#	You know, long dark hair.
1	#	Flowing?
1	#	Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?
1	#	Just clarifying.
1	#	Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to get it out?
1	#	I think you'll get it out.
1	#	She's got a fine cheek.
1	#	A pinkish hue?
1	#	There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her eyebrows.
1	#	I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.
1	#	I think it's tamber.
1	#	I didn't notice the voice.
1	#	So, Saturday night.
1	#	She could have mentioned the conversation.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Oh, the guy from Jersey?
1	#	No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.
1	#	So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back by now, what did they do?
1	#	Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?
1	#	Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.
1	#	Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.
1	#	Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.
1	#	You can tell me, I'll vault it.
1	#	I'm locking the vault. What?
1	#	Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?
1	#	At your apartment?
1	#	She didn't stay over?
1	#	So, what did she have to say?
1	#	He said they had a good time.
1	#	Oh, good.
1	#	Nope. You?
1	#	You sure?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah. Okay then.
1	#	Goodnight.
1	#	Well, I'm gonna do something about this.
1	#	Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever. She's not going to get away with this.
1	#	I'm gonna call her.
1	#	No, I'm calling her.
1	#	No, forget it, I'm gonna call.
1	#	Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.
1	#	George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?
1	#	I'll just call her when you leave!
1	#	It is so my business!
1	#	Yeah, but--
1	#	But Kramer--
1	#	Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!
1	#	Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!
1	#	Oh, hi. Soda?
1	#	So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?
1	#	Oh, I know her. I know her type.
1	#	The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!
1	#	I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.
1	#	Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!
1	#	I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?
1	#	I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?
1	#	Get your finger out of my face.
1	#	I don't care.
1	#	How did you know they were defective?!
1	#	Acting.
1	#	Thank you. Hi Cynthia.
1	#	Well this is a great place to sit you got here.
1	#	So what are these?
1	#	I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.
1	#	That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.
1	#	You chuck.
1	#	Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.
1	#	Believe me I didn't see anything.
1	#	No, did you?
1	#	Why?
1	#	I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.
1	#	All right
1	#	All right
1	#	You know who that is? That's
1	#	Yeah, that's him.
1	#	Positive.
1	#	Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.
1	#	So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.
1	#	Hey, should we say something to him?
1	#	well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.
1	#	So?
1	#	I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.
1	#	Really?
1	#	What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time
1	#	Thank you.
1	#	I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.
1	#	I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.
1	#	Oh. that would be great.
1	#	It's been three days and he hasn't called.
1	#	I can't ... I can't
1	#	I don't know. I just feel he should call me.
1	#	You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.
1	#	I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?
1	#	I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.
1	#	Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
1	#	What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.
1	#	Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!
1	#	Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?
1	#	I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?
1	#	For what dinner?
1	#	Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?
1	#	... this is all .. very confusing.
1	#	Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?
1	#	Oh, see the baby again with the baby..
1	#	Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.
1	#	(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?
1	#	uh uh because then it would be all grown up.
1	#	Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?
1	#	I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.
1	#	Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.
1	#	Hellooo Newman.
1	#	Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.
1	#	Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.
1	#	What happened to your head when you got hit?
1	#	Again
1	#	Back and to the left Back and to the left
1	#	I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.
1	#	But that is not what they would have you believe.
1	#	The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.
1	#	No. What happened to you?
1	#	I'm Vandelay Industries?
1	#	And what is that?
1	#	Latex? And what do I do with latex?
1	#	And what do I say about you?
1	#	I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?
1	#	I don't think so. Why would I do that?
1	#	If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	All right we're coming down.
1	#	Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.
1	#	That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.
1	#	Well that was really fun, thanks.
1	#	Well, ...
1	#	No, I haven't.
1	#	Sure, that would be great.
1	#	I mean, ... if you want to.
1	#	Yeah, Friday's okay.
1	#	Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]
1	#	Elaine?
1	#	Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.
1	#	For a date?
1	#	Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?
1	#	.... (silence)
1	#	So then we went to dinner.
1	#	We split it.
1	#	Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.
1	#	Yeah
1	#	Come on up.
1	#	Uh, nuthin'. Then he took me home.
1	#	(smiling) Yeah
1	#	Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.
1	#	He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.
1	#	So then as I was getting out of the car, ...
1	#	Hi Elaine.
1	#	What date? It's a GUY.
1	#	Already?
1	#	I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?
1	#	Oh, ya' going?
1	#	Ah, really.
1	#	Friday?
1	#	He's going' out with you on Friday?
1	#	He's supposed to see ME on Friday.
1	#	We made plans.
1	#	No, don't cancel it.
1	#	Well, frankly it is.
1	#	Well you're not even a fan. I was at game six - you didn't even watch it.
1	#	Any Hennigans around here?
1	#	Vandelay Industries, Kel Varnsen speaking. May we help you? ... Oh Hi Keith. Na, I was just jokin' around
1	#	No. No. I don't mind at all.
1	#	Sure, we can do something next week.
1	#	No, its no problem at all.
1	#	Okay, take it easy. (hangs up) That was Keith. we're going to do something next week.
1	#	Hey what are you doing Friday night?
1	#	Friday night? Nothin', ... now.
1	#	Fasten your seat belts. we're goin' to see the baby.
1	#	All right, I'll go
1	#	And you want to be my latex salesman.
1	#	(to baby) Hello. How are you/
1	#	Yes. I do love her. (to baby) You have a very nice place here.
1	#	He's joking.
1	#	I was saying the same thing.
1	#	Uh, you don't have to take a picture.
1	#	Jerry, You want to pick her up?
1	#	I better not.
1	#	I don't know him. I know who he is.
1	#	I know. He got the hit in game SIX. So, so then what happened?
1	#	So, did you two, uh,  have uh,
1	#	You know
1	#	No!
1	#	Did he kiss you good night?
1	#	What do you mean you don't know?
1	#	Well, what kind of a kiss? Was it a peck? Was it a kiss? Was it a long make out thing?
1	#	So, you like him.
1	#	Ah, I'm jealous of everybody.
1	#	hello. Oh, hi. What's happening?  what? oh um, sure,  um, yeah, okay, uh. I'll see you then. Yeah, yeah, Bye.
1	#	That was Keith.
1	#	He wants me to help him move.
1	#	You know, furniture.
1	#	I said yes, but I don't feel right about it. I mean I hardly know the guy. That's a big step oin a relationship. The biggest. That's like going all the way.
1	#	Well we went out one time. Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong?
1	#	Keith Hernandez just asked me to help him move.
1	#	I said yes.
1	#	I'm NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT! ..
1	#	hey Kramer do me a favour .
1	#	Don't mention it to anybody.
1	#	She likes him I mean she really likes him.
1	#	Who wouldn't like him? I like him. And I'm a guy.
1	#	Forget that. He's a ball player. MVP< 1979. I'm making wise cracks in some night club. This guy was in game six. They're a perfect match. They like go together. They're like one of these brother and sister couples that look alike.
1	#	You know I know this sounds a little arrogant but I never thought she would find anyone she would like better than me. Ya know, I guess I had my chance and that's that.
1	#	Really?
1	#	I don't know  six three.
1	#	So I guess it's fair to say you've set different goals for yourself than say, Thomas Edison, Magellan, these types of people.
1	#	Oh, yeah,. My favourite explorer. Around the world. Come on.
1	#	DeSoto? What did he do?
1	#	Oh. like they wouldn't have found that anyway.
1	#	No I can't I've got some stuff to do then I've got to meet Keith at my apartment at three. I'm helping him move.
1	#	I know isn't that something?
1	#	I don't know  he's got some valuable antiques, He's worried they'll break something.
1	#	I'M NOT DRIVING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!
1	#	Is there a box spring?
1	#	Is there a box spring?
1	#	Is that a sectional?
1	#	Is that a thick marble?
1	#	STAIRS??? There's no elevator?
1	#	I'm sorry I can't do this. I can't do it. I can't. It, it's too soon. I don't know you. I can't help you move. I'm sorry. I can't. I just can't.
1	#	I told you!
1	#	But why? Why McDowell?
1	#	Hello,  oh hi Elaine .. what's going on  no he just left  you broke up with him?  ME TOO .. what happened?  oh smoking you know you're like going out with C. Everet Coope  me  nah  I couldn't go through with it  I just didn't feel ready  so what are you doing now?  Oh, great idea, I'll meet you there in like thirty minutes. Okay bye.
1	#	You just missed him. he just left. What do you need him for?
1	#	Well Biff/ What's next?
1	#	George.
1	#	Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?
1	#	Oh I can't believe-- why don't you get rid of that piece of junk.
1	#	So you have no car?
1	#	So what good are you?
1	#	I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while, O'Brien's not showing up.
1	#	He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him on the plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden.
1	#	Yeah, right.
1	#	He's definitely in Chicago.
1	#	How would we do it?
1	#	Maybe he knows O'Brien?
1	#	What if we get caught?
1	#	Who's gonna be O'Brien?
1	#	Who am I?
1	#	Just me?
1	#	Okay.
1	#	Well if you're gonna be O'Brien, why can't I be somebody?
1	#	Dylan Murphy.
1	#	What, now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
1	#	You could be Colin.
1	#	I'm Dylan Murphy.
1	#	Come on,
1	#	Colin?
1	#	What for?
1	#	She happy for you?
1	#	No. Why?
1	#	He can't hear us.
1	#	Where's he dropping us? Maybe we can get him to drop us right at my house?
1	#	What?
1	#	We're going to the Knick game!
1	#	I can't believe it! You may have hit with this one!
1	#	Lemme call Elaine and Kramer.
1	#	Elaine? It's me. What are you doing tonight? Great. George and I have tickets, four free passes to the Knicks-Bulls game, Madison Square Garden. Can you go? Great, listen, call Kramer, tell him to meet us on the corner at seven o'clock. Alright. We're gonna pick you up in a limo. That's right baby-doll. Hey listen, when we pick you up, I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien. I can't tell you now, it's a long story. I am serious. Okay. Okay bye. (opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, we have to make a little stop first.
1	#	Maybe it's a shortcut.
1	#	(opens partition) 'Scuse me, driver, why are we getting off this exit?
1	#	It was a bad jig to begin with, we never should have started this jig.
1	#	It was a bad jig, a terrible terrible jig. What are we gonna do now? They're gonna know you're not O'Brien.
1	#	First of all, you don't look like any O'Brien, period.
1	#	I don't want to be Murphy anymore; do I still have to be Murphy?
1	#	It makes no sense now, me being Murphy.
1	#	I'm Seinfeld!
1	#	We're doing sixty miles an hour!
1	#	Who are you, Mannix?
1	#	Alright put your hands up over your face, pretend you're sleeping.
1	#	No, I'm, uh, Dylan Murphy. Mr. O'Brien had a long trip, he's sleeping.
1	#	Newsletter?
1	#	Oh, yes, he's very proud of his work in the big game. So you've never uh, met him before?
1	#	Never seen a picture of him?
1	#	Not even on the book jacket?
1	#	(nudging George) Hey O'Brien, wake up, c'mon, we got company. Wake up.
1	#	(checking his watch) I don't think we're gonna make the tip off.
1	#	He tends to exaggerate.
1	#	Well you might as well look it over.
1	#	You're not going to open with that, are you?
1	#	Nice looking Lugar.
1	#	What's taking him so long out there?
1	#	She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi!
1	#	Well we gotta make a plan before they come back, what are we gonna do?
1	#	Let's just make a run for it.
1	#	How'd that happen?
1	#	I know, why do they make that bed so tight? You gotta sleep with your feet like that.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Nah. No one's ever been shot in the city.
1	#	I may not look like a Murphy but I act like a Murphy.
1	#	Dublin. Originally. Parents came over here when I was eighteen. Cereal famine. Couldn't get a bowl anywhere. Bad. 'Tis a beautiful country though; lush rolling hills, and the peat, ah the peat.
1	#	We were right on the border.
1	#	Get in the car! Get in the car!
1	#	No, he was talking to me, he's cross-eyed.
1	#	It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.
1	#	Oh look at this guy.
1	#	Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.
1	#	No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?
1	#	Give me that wave!
1	#	Yeah, I'm free, why?
1	#	Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!
1	#	What?
1	#	Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.
1	#	I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice)
1	#	Wait, he stopped, he's parking.
1	#	Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.
1	#	So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.
1	#	You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.
1	#	He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)
1	#	Let's not even analyze it.
1	#	I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.
1	#	Friday night.
1	#	Yep.
1	#	Come on up.
1	#	By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.
1	#	Oh, you dig?
1	#	Why?
1	#	I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.
1	#	Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!
1	#	On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!
1	#	What am I drinking, milk?
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Thank you.
1	#	With that?
1	#	What car?
1	#	Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.
1	#	Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand)
1	#	Yeah, Queens.
1	#	So he gets out of the car, I say, "Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!" So he says to me, "What are ya gonna do about it?"
1	#	So I said to him, "Whatever's necessary."
1	#	What?
1	#	Oh, it was nothing.
1	#	Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)
1	#	I know a little.
1	#	He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.
1	#	Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)
1	#	Australia?
1	#	But not anymore.
1	#	Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.
1	#	We just met.
1	#	Ask George to go with you.
1	#	Why do you even need anybody?
1	#	Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.
1	#	Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.
1	#	Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.
1	#	The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.
1	#	Come on up.
1	#	No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.
1	#	What if she's having an off night?
1	#	Hi.
1	#	A stupid what?
1	#	You know, if you want to make a person feel better after they sneeze, you shouldn't say 'God bless you', you should say, 'You're soo good lookin''.
1	#	Entertainment Tonight's on.
1	#	Bedroom.
1	#	What's it like out?
1	#	Can I take a sweater?
1	#	Scarf?
1	#	What's the matter? What's going on?
1	#	What is wrong?!
1	#	Get together?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	What car?
1	#	Yeah who?
1	#	The blond with the blue sweatpants! Yeah, I think I've seen her.
1	#	The blond with the blue sweatpants!
1	#	I've had a crush on this woman for year! I've always been afraid to approach her! She looks like she belongs on one of these Hallmark cards.
1	#	Oh yeah. Too bad. Angela. Lousy thug. I mean what kind of sick person does something like that? That woman belongs in prison! I mean, I actually owe it to society to do something about this! I can't sit by and allow this to go on. It's a moral issue is what it is!
1	#	How am I going to live with myself?!
1	#	I'm not religious, but I certainly know where to draw the line!
1	#	Don't sell yourself short saying 'God bless you' to every Tom, Dick and Harry in great personal risk.
1	#	There should be more people like us.
1	#	You're telling me.
1	#	Anyway, I just wanted you to know, that I'm going to do everything I can to make sure the party responsible is made to be responsible or something very close to that.
1	#	Thank you very much.
1	#	Let me rephra-
1	#	Hi Elaine, this is Angela.
1	#	Well I think I get the gist of it.
1	#	What car?
1	#	It's not complicated.
1	#	Alright Elaine.
1	#	It was just a couple of blocks.
1	#	It's not that hard.
1	#	Hold it! Hold it! Hold it people! Matador? What matador?
1	#	A matador! Well, well, well. Uno momento por favor. Pray tell, what was the young man's name?
1	#	Eduardo, Carochio! That's good. That's very good. Kind of just rolls of the tongue. I wonder where on the upper west side a single girl might meet a matador? Perhaps Zabars? Or Les Pizza!
1	#	Anyway, this person told me to tell you to get an estimate on the damage.
1	#	$875?
1	#	Uh, well, I'll tell you what. Um, I'll give you a check, and then this person can pay me back.
1	#	Um, who do I make it out to?
1	#	So, what are you doing this weekend?
1	#	I didn't do it!
1	#	You are soo good lookin'.
1	#	You sure you want to do this? I'm going to be on the road for three weeks!
1	#	Alright!
1	#	What?!
1	#	What did I do?
1	#	I-
1	#	I didn't do it! I just had to pay her to cover for somebody else!
1	#	No, never.
1	#	You got a date with Becky Gelke?!
1	#	Well I'm happy to help, in any way that I can.
1	#	I like the button fly.
1	#	That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking metal teeth. Its like a mink trap down there. (beat) What are you doing today?
1	#	I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check out her paintings?
1	#	Theres nothing to get.
1	#	She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting Kramer right now.
1	#	She sees something in him.
1	#	Why?
1	#	I don't know how long this is gonna last.
1	#	I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like me having fun with anyone but her. (knocks on the door)
1	#	Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George.
1	#	(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this guy!
1	#	(to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
1	#	May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the painting)
1	#	What's this?
1	#	(sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm going out of town.
1	#	They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!
1	#	Is he okay?
1	#	This is the most amazing story I've ever heard--why did he want you to take off the baseball cap? That is so insane!
1	#	How you feeling?
1	#	(pointing) There's George!
1	#	It's preposterous! They ask someone to take off a baseball cap at a baseball game. (beat) How can you defend that?
1	#	Look, I'm really getting tired off all the fighting. Maybe we should just end this before we really start hating each other.
1	#	Well, I like to remain friends with people I was friends with!
1	#	That's what she told me!
1	#	That's what it costs!
1	#	I wasn't thinking! I don't know.
1	#	Well, she framed it and everything.
1	#	Do you want me to paint you something? I'd love to paint you some- thing!
1	#	(looking at the paper) Wow, a letter from Nina!
1	#	(reading note) Oh my god!
1	#	This is amazing, you can't believe this!
1	#	Listen to this "I don't know what you expect to find out there, Jerry, you know what you want better than me. But there's one thing I do know. I know I can stand here watching you destroy everything I've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists, because you won't make even the slightest effort to offer happiness and still know that I love you. You mean so much to me that I'm will-ing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
1	#	(reading on) "...'cause that's what you need to do to prove I'm not going to leave you. I'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships. You want me, that fight for me, becau-"
1	#	No one's ever written me a letter like this. Maybe I was wrong about her!
1	#	Should I?
1	#	ALL RIGHT, all right! I'll call her.
1	#	SHOT! (the sound of a shot on the TV is heard) I told ya! (the inter- com buzzes) Yeah?
1	#	Come on up. (to Nina) Well, now we gotta get a posse together. I love a good posse.
1	#	The appeal of the posse? The posse has tremendous appeal. Get away from the job, camp out, you're with your friends... Come on, it's a week-long game of hide-and-seek on horseback.
1	#	Yeah?
1	#	Come on up.
1	#	...Yeah.
1	#	She likes the pop-in. I've told her how I hate the pop-in. (pointing to George) He likes the pop-in, too.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	HUGE pop-in guy!
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Okay!
1	#	If he noticed, he would have called you from Houston!
1	#	(tugging at the clicker) I'm a great clicker! (gets the clicker back) Great instincts. How dare you impune my clicking.
1	#	Let go!
1	#	Let go, Elaine!
1	#	Oh, George can't click! (George joins in the fight)
1	#	Wait, wait a second! Go back, go back to that. (they watch it a little longer)
1	#	(on to something) Wait a second... wait a second!! (he watches the TV for another minute) The letter, that's the letter!
1	#	This is the letter she wrote to me, she stole it right from the movie!
1	#	"...'cause you don't even make the slightest effort to offer happiness still know that I love you!!"
1	#	I always thought there was something funny about this letter! She copied it right out of Chapter 2! She a thief, a bunko-artist!
1	#	What are you talking about? She completely misrepresented herself! (mimicking the letter) I don't offer happiness. I offer happiness! James Caan doesn't offer happiness!
1	#	How's it coming?
1	#	Seen any good movies lately?
1	#	No. I like a good comedy. You know, like a Neil Simon? You like Neil Simon?
1	#	I've seen MOST of it. I guess my favorite would have to be, uh... Chapter 2. Have you ever seen that?
1	#	I have. Funny, funny. In fact it was on TV just the other night. Happened to catch it. (a knock is heard at the door) I couldn't help notice a STUNNING similiarity-- (Jerry is interrupted as Nina opens answer the door...)
1	#	Boy, the Yankees cannot buy a hit tonight!
1	#	Yeah. (picks up Nina's painting George bought) And by the way, can you get this thing outta my house?
1	#	What are you talking about?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Oh yeah, I know.
1	#	What's the difference?
1	#	You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?
1	#	If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?
1	#	You have to know, you must know.
1	#	Well, I'm not telling you.
1	#	Nope. I don't think so.
1	#	Not today, pal.
1	#	Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.
1	#	Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.
1	#	I loaned the car to George.
1	#	George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!
1	#	Huh?
1	#	Will you stop it already?!
1	#	I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!
1	#	*I* don't like you!
1	#	Why not?
1	#	Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.
1	#	No, I like Mike.
1	#	Oh yeah? What did you talk about?
1	#	Oh yeah? What did he say?
1	#	No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?
1	#	Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.
1	#	Please, don't make me beg.
1	#	Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.
1	#	Kramer!
1	#	Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.
1	#	I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!
1	#	He what?
1	#	A phony? He called me a phony?
1	#	Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!
1	#	Yeah, under the counter. What happened?
1	#	(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.
1	#	He is?
1	#	A gun?!
1	#	My god, are you okay?
1	#	Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.
1	#	Where's George now?
1	#	What are you talking about?
1	#	(leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!
1	#	Are you okay?
1	#	Crazy kids, huh?
1	#	Oh, hey Mike.
1	#	I'm coming down.
1	#	Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.
1	#	Yeah, he's a real phony.
1	#	Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.
1	#	Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.
1	#	Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.
1	#	I didn't know.
1	#	I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!
1	#	You're right. My fault.
1	#	It was a so-so sorry.
1	#	Wild pack of teenagers, huh?
1	#	Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.
1	#	Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,
1	#	What did you do to my car?!
1	#	I thought you said you were a good driver!
1	#	I think you said driver.
1	#	Hey Sid.
1	#	Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.
1	#	What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?
1	#	Hey Matthew.
1	#	How ya doing?
1	#	Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.
1	#	Oh no, nothing.
1	#	No, no, no, no.
1	#	No, of course not, of course not!
1	#	I didn't--
1	#	(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?
1	#	Mike thinks I'm a phony.
1	#	Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.
1	#	I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.
1	#	Open my vault?
1	#	Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.
1	#	Oy ga-vault.
1	#	Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?
1	#	Well if he's going then I'm not going.
1	#	I still don't have to go.
1	#	Why? I'll tell you why.
1	#	Like you didn't call me a phony?
1	#	Use it in a sentence.
1	#	Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?
1	#	Kramer, what are you doing here!?
1	#	You scared me!
1	#	That's enough!
1	#	Kramer! What are you doing?!
1	#	Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!
1	#	C'mon!
1	#	Move it! Move it! Get going!
1	#	Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your apartment?
1	#	Oh. I see. There he is! (Pretends the murderers are coming.)
1	#	The murderers! (Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.)
1	#	Did you see the look on that guy's face?
1	#	Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
1	#	All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.
1	#	What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your key privileges.
1	#	No, come on!
1	#	It was sold out!
1	#	That's the point.
1	#	Just, look, just give the keys.
1	#	Don't ask me!
1	#	I'm telling you.
1	#	I'm serious!
1	#	Yes it will, now give me those keys!
1	#	So put 'em in a safe place.
1	#	Where?
1	#	I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.
1	#	I can't.
1	#	Who's there?
1	#	Elaine...
1	#	Take the keys.
1	#	O.K.!
1	#	Your spare set?
1	#	You want 'em back?
1	#	Did you bring the keys?
1	#	This could be an emergency!
1	#	I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. (Jerry and George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.)
1	#	They lost.
1	#	Kramer?
1	#	Hello, Newman.
1	#	Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!
1	#	You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?
1	#	Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!
1	#	Turn around, George.
1	#	Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have to do this the hard way? (Hits wall with his fist.)
1	#	Where's Kramer?
1	#	We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
1	#	Bad rap?
1	#	Me?
1	#	L.A.?
1	#	I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't you see it?
1	#	Huh?
1	#	No, what'd you say?
1	#	Oh, you didn't see it.
1	#	I heard you say something, there.
1	#	I'm calling Kramer's mother. (Picks up the phone, dials.) (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the music down? Could you turn the music down!
1	#	She's drunk out of her mind.
1	#	Don't feel right? What are you talking about?
1	#	What is the big deal?
1	#	First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.
1	#	Well, I want those keys. (Tries to grab the keys from George.)
1	#	George, give them to me, I want these keys. (They struggle over the keys.) I don't want to get physical!
1	#	Do you wanna fight?
1	#	Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.
1	#	What's that?
1	#	I heard something.
1	#	Well, this is great.
1	#	They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In disgust) "What do they look like."
1	#	Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.
1	#	By Elaine Benes?
1	#	Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?
1	#	Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
1	#	All right, here!
1	#	What? What?
1	#	It was funny!
1	#	Well... (picks up some of the pages) From what I saw...
1	#	I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.
1	#	I did not!
1	#	Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!
1	#	Good!
1	#	Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
1	#	Is that something you want to do?
1	#	Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to each other.
1	#	What did you say?
1	#	I heard something. (Looks at the TV) Elaine, Elaine! It's Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!
1	#	Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!
1	#	So, what's her name?
1	#	Is she nice?
1	#	So you like her?
1	#	You don't know?
1	#	Well do you feel anything?
1	#	All right, let me ask you this when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?
1	#	You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?
1	#	You do the tub?
1	#	On your knees, Ajax, hands scrubbin', the whole deal?
1	#	Okay, I think you're in love!
1	#	Tub is love.
1	#	So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
1	#	Sexual?
1	#	Below the equator?
1	#	Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.
1	#	You got the tap?
1	#	The tap is tough.
1	#	Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
1	#	It's a very complicated area.
1	#	It's a haaazy mystery.
1	#	Really?
1	#	And the guy never knows?
1	#	How can he not know that?
1	#	I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
1	#	What?
1	#	Are you saying...
1	#	With me?
1	#	You faked with me?
1	#	You faked with me?
1	#	No.
1	#	You faked it?
1	#	That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?
1	#	What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?
1	#	I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?
1	#	All the time?!
1	#	But I'm so good.
1	#	She faked.
1	#	Maybe they've all been faking.
1	#	No no, it was no joke.
1	#	No. None.
1	#	(raising hand) Faked 'em all.
1	#	The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.
1	#	How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.
1	#	What could you have done?
1	#	I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
1	#	Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.
1	#	Hello... Oh hello Elaine.
1	#	I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.
1	#	What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.
1	#	Oooh that. Well...
1	#	Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
1	#	All right.
1	#	Bye.
1	#	I really don't feel like seeing her.
1	#	(confused) What?!
1	#	You faked it? Why would you do that?
1	#	Yeah, but why would you... (Kramer is eating a peach then disgusted he spits it out) Bad peach?
1	#	Did you get that at Joe's?
1	#	That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.
1	#	You're returning used fruit?
1	#	Satisfied?
1	#	Meryl Streep?
1	#	Ah, she's okay.
1	#	Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
1	#	Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?
1	#	Nothing.
1	#	Nooo.
1	#	Give me another shot!
1	#	Another shot, I want another shot.
1	#	Yes!
1	#	Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!
1	#	Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .
1	#	We won't ruin the friendship.
1	#	Elaine...
1	#	A half hour, give me a half our.
1	#	Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!
1	#	You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?
1	#	That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.
1	#	Come on, Elaine!
1	#	Elaine?!
1	#	Well good night.
1	#	Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.
1	#	Oh what, you're upset?
1	#	No I can't, maybe you're faking.
1	#	I'm sorry too.
1	#	You're a baby!
1	#	They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?
1	#	You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Why can't you get it?
1	#	What happened?
1	#	(to George) No. (to Kramer) I told you not to say anything.
1	#	Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
1	#	Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?
1	#	Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I-I just wanted to ask you a question when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Ya, Okay, bye.
1	#	Patty Lawrence had 'em!
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
1	#	Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
1	#	All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
1	#	Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
1	#	How soft?
1	#	(looking over the list) Hmm ah. I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?
1	#	Uh huh. Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
1	#	Plantains?
1	#	What the hell is a plantain.
1	#	(grabbing the list from Kramer) You're not getting any plantains.
1	#	Hey Joe.
1	#	Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Uh, gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. Alright let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... (looks at Joe; Joe gives him a weird look)ooo, just right... and three plantains uh ought to do it.
1	#	What?
1	#	(shocked) Wha, what are you talking about?
1	#	I can't buy mangos and plantains?
1	#	You're making a big mistake, Joe!
1	#	Are saying you're banning me from the store?
1	#	I'm banned?!
1	#	Put it over there.
1	#	What are you doing?
1	#	You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
1	#	Sorry, I don't have any cash.
1	#	What?
1	#	What is it?
1	#	Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. (Elaine smiles and rolls her eyes at him) What brings you here?
1	#	Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
1	#	Well I'll get them.
1	#	All right. (goes into his hallway and comes back) You got my fins?
1	#	I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
1	#	They're next to the poker chips.
1	#	I guess.
1	#	Yeah, see you.
1	#	(shocked) What?
1	#	Are you serious?
1	#	Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.
1	#	It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!
1	#	Oh, it won't be for that long.
1	#	Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.
1	#	My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
1	#	My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
1	#	A smirk?
1	#	I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
1	#	(Stopping the notion) What's that?
1	#	(quietly) Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
1	#	Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..
1	#	No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys-
1	#	(setting down a box) No thanks.
1	#	I really don't eat it.
1	#	I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building..
1	#	Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend.
1	#	Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?'
1	#	Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)
1	#	Right.
1	#	Well..
1	#	Excuse me?
1	#	Yeah.. yeah.
1	#	Puffy.
1	#	Yeah, that's right!
1	#	(Points at Elaine) And the indigent.
1	#	Sure.
1	#	Uh-huh.
1	#	Yep..
1	#	(Shrugs) I - I don't get it.
1	#	What is it?
1	#	They're hands!
1	#	(Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.
1	#	Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life.
1	#	It's just like in the movies.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	(Explaining) George has become a hand model.
1	#	Yes.
1	#	Oven mitts?
1	#	Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)
1	#	Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up) Since I said what?
1	#	What are you talking about?
1	#	(Goes up to it) This?
1	#	I agreed to wear this?!
1	#	But, when did I do that?
1	#	What are you, crazy?!
1	#	I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding!
1	#	Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!
1	#	But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her!
1	#	I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous!
1	#	They're making these?
1	#	(Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!
1	#	(Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this!
1	#	(Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her!
1	#	When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.
1	#	(Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks!
1	#	(Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak!
1	#	(Mumbling out) Thank you, Bryant.
1	#	(Looking down at the shirt; mumbling) Oh, thank you.
1	#	Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.
1	#	(Nervous laughter) Yeah.. like a pirate.. (Attempting to get on another subject) Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh..
1	#	Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)
1	#	(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.
1	#	What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding)
1	#	(Pointing off screen, nodding) THAT I heard.
1	#	Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you.
1	#	(Reasoning) You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place!
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that!
1	#	Really? What happened?
1	#	What happened with all the shirts?
1	#	(While digging in his pocket for some money, he looks over the shirts one last time) You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt..
1	#	No. You?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	You got me the air conditioner?
1	#	Beautiful!
1	#	Is it a good one?
1	#	Commando 8?
1	#	All right.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth? (Elaine laughs silently)
1	#	He was running from a bee. (Elaine laughs)
1	#	There's a lot of change down there.
1	#	We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!
1	#	Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.
1	#	(bored) Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it.
1	#	(While looking at posters of women wearing glasses) I think these women would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.
1	#	Are you okay? Did he bite ya?
1	#	Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
1	#	(To George) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?
1	#	All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.
1	#	What's the matter?
1	#	What is it?
1	#	Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George) What do you mean you can't tell me?
1	#	I'm asking!
1	#	Yeah, yeah, take care of it. (Jerry throws her some toilet paper) Come on, George, what is it?
1	#	What?
1	#	Amy and Jeffrey?
1	#	Are you sure?
1	#	But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.
1	#	We're gonna have to talk about this later. (Elaine holds the door open for Jerry while holding her leg) Thank you. Taxi!
1	#	Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks Department.
1	#	But he was squinting.
1	#	Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!
1	#	Nah, look at this. Cable's out.
1	#	No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. (Jerry picks up the phone and dials the number) I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?
1	#	Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.
1	#	(laughing) Oh you must have done something.
1	#	Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
1	#	Well, your day's getting more interesting already. (Jerry shows the phone) Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.
1	#	No you can't. (hangs up the phone) Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?
1	#	Look, my friend saw you.
1	#	You tell me.
1	#	There isn't?
1	#	Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?
1	#	Why?
1	#	No, no, there's no side!
1	#	No, no, no ugly side.
1	#	Why?
1	#	Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?
1	#	It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat locker in here.
1	#	I was an idiot for listening to you!
1	#	Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. Now she sees a side.
1	#	A bad side, an ugly side.
1	#	So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.
1	#	Ah, he'd just deny it.
1	#	Amy said nothing happened.
1	#	Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!
1	#	They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.
1	#	(Stunned) No, keep it. (Elaine enters the apartment) Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
1	#	A little white dog?
1	#	Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?
1	#	He's like a squirrel.
1	#	You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.
1	#	Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!
1	#	I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.
1	#	Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's Howdy Doody time.
1	#	I don't know what to tell you, Elton.
1	#	(To George) Who picked these out?
1	#	They're ladies' glasses! You know all you need is that little chain around your neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.
1	#	Hey, hey.
1	#	Take it to the window.
1	#	Just in time for Amy.
1	#	Rabies.
1	#	Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?
1	#	Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature Channel.
1	#	He does look like a horse.
1	#	Hey, shall we spit on him?
1	#	Oh, you'll find out.
1	#	Well, I'm very mysterious by nature. (Jerry knocks on the door) A lot of women find that attractive.
1	#	Oh?
1	#	Uncle Leo?!
1	#	This is Amy.
1	#	Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?
1	#	Ooh! Very convenient.
1	#	Oh really?
1	#	Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
1	#	Thank you.
1	#	To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
1	#	That's right, lady!
1	#	I thought you'd like that.
1	#	Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.
1	#	Thank you.
1	#	(To Amy) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!
1	#	Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.
1	#	Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?
1	#	I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it. Plus I had to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that guy got my name.
1	#	So, does he like you?
1	#	You like him?
1	#	So, how did you meet him?
1	#	So, he's a writer.
1	#	Yeah, big surprise.
1	#	So, what did you do?
1	#	Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.
1	#	Oh, what do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.
1	#	(taps on the window) Hey...
1	#	That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.
1	#	Hey Barry, how you doing?
1	#	This is my friend George.
1	#	Yeah, so how's my money?
1	#	What, you got a cold?
1	#	Bathroom uh, bathroom's uh right over there.
1	#	Did you see that?
1	#	What was all that sniffing?
1	#	You don't think...?
1	#	I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy could write checks to himself right out of my account.
1	#	Then, what was all that sniffing?
1	#	Today's not cold.
1	#	Sniffing, with his nose.
1	#	No, I asked him.
1	#	I don't know, you know, what if...?
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	All I know he was sniffing.
1	#	I know.
1	#	Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just means he was sniffing.
1	#	No, he didn't use 'man'.
1	#	No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.
1	#	Do you think that's a bad sign?
1	#	I don't know. (takes off his sweater) This sweater really itches me. You want it?
1	#	You're out of your mind you know that.
1	#	It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under it.
1	#	A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.
1	#	George was right. Didn't take you long.
1	#	Good idea. (Jerry calls Barry's office)
1	#	Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.
1	#	Out of town?
1	#	South America?
1	#	I'll call back, thank you. (hangs up the phone) He went to South America!
1	#	Who goes to South America?
1	#	Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large intestine.
1	#	Yes, I'm impugning a continent.
1	#	Hello Newman.
1	#	Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and find out...
1	#	All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.
1	#	Yeah maybe you should.
1	#	All right, what are you gonna say to him?
1	#	No, you stay here in the car.
1	#	All right Newman, one more peep outta you, you're out of the whole operation!
1	#	There he is. He's going into that bar.
1	#	Be careful Kramer.
1	#	No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.
1	#	I might need you to get me a soda.
1	#	You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.
1	#	You should try this.
1	#	Not even once?
1	#	You're an idiot.
1	#	Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.
1	#	What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like it?
1	#	Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination of our relationship effective immediately.'
1	#	I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later than the 18th'.
1	#	Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.
1	#	Yeah, thanks.
1	#	You know this...
1	#	Hi Ralph.
1	#	All right.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Mohair, I think.
1	#	You mean you just started sniffing?
1	#	I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry came in.
1	#	Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all over it!
1	#	The what??
1	#	Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
1	#	It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.
1	#	Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and spent it on drugs!
1	#	What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the money back. Which I would've done, if a certain imbecile had been able to get to a mailbox and mail a letter!!
1	#	Think so?
1	#	Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?
1	#	(interrupting) Thanks, that's enough.
1	#	(Looking away) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1	#	Yeah, I looked. I saw.
1	#	No, Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE TO ELAINE) My friend's wife's breast sticking out - why would that make me uncomfortable?
1	#	So how long do they do this?
1	#	No break?
1	#	So after the sucking, comes the weaning.
1	#	Well, you gotta wean.
1	#	Yeah, I saw the spot.
1	#	George...
1	#	(to Elaine) Where's Kramer? Shouldn't he be here by now.
1	#	Ya, 1397.
1	#	Will you shut up George.
1	#	You were saying Stan? I-I'm sorry about that.
1	#	Me? Godfather?
1	#	(a la "Don Corleone") Never go against the family, Elaine.
1	#	(a la "Don Corleione") Elaine, never ask me about my business!.... (SHEEPISH) "Godfather."
1	#	The bris?
1	#	Well, maybe we should.
1	#	Maybe they're admiring your spot.
1	#	A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.
1	#	Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?
1	#	You mean that wasn't uh.
1	#	No.. you?
1	#	What'd you think?
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Ah, you're screwed.
1	#	How about our little Elaine huh? Attended the finest finishing schools on the Eastern seaboard. Equestrian competitions. Debutante balls. Look at her now. Interviewing Mohels.
1	#	What's the matter?
1	#	What now?
1	#	(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) "Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research".." Government funds genetic research at area hospital" ... Yeah, so?
1	#	Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!
1	#	Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. "Oo that little tail really turns me on."
1	#	Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?
1	#	(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?
1	#	So what'd you think?
1	#	Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.
1	#	Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.
1	#	Well, if I hear an anguished "oink", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)
1	#	Oh, it's George.
1	#	Alright Kramer, enough of this. Let's go find George.
1	#	Kramer.
1	#	Where's the Mohel?
1	#	He's late already.
1	#	I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?
1	#	Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.
1	#	Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.
1	#	Hello.
1	#	(uncertain) Yeah. I'm holding the baby.
1	#	I'm going.
1	#	I'm going.
1	#	Don't push me.
1	#	Hurry up George! Step on it!
1	#	That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!
1	#	Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?
1	#	Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!
1	#	Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.
1	#	A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!
1	#	That was a one in a million Mohel.
1	#	Look at this.
1	#	Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.
1	#	Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?
1	#	Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!
1	#	Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy.
1	#	Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING)
1	#	It was not!
1	#	(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.
1	#	(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.
1	#	Myra, Stan.
1	#	What's the matter?
1	#	Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't see us watching them? To me tennis is basically just ping-pong and the players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, shh."
1	#	Are these seats unbelievable or what?
1	#	Here.
1	#	What, are you on Mercury?
1	#	You got a problem with paba?
1	#	You don't even know what paba is.
1	#	I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
1	#	You're bringing a date to a party?
1	#	A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) Ho, ho, ho.
1	#	Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.
1	#	That woman is absolutely stunning.
1	#	Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful lineswoman I've ever seen.
1	#	B.L.?
1	#	I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. The woman is absolutely mesmerizing.
1	#	I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
1	#	I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that just walk across the hot coals.
1	#	I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
1	#	I can't.
1	#	I don't know, "Hi".
1	#	Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. Yea nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?
1	#	I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf.
1	#	Can't hear a thing.
1	#	Yeah, isn't that something?
1	#	Really?
1	#	I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
1	#	Wow good plan.
1	#	That's nice.
1	#	(turning to Kramer) That's nice for the freaks.
1	#	Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about that friend of yours that works at the ticket agency.
1	#	Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There are no ball men.
1	#	All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man go ahead, break the ball barrier. (Elaine drinks straight out of the orange juice container) Hey.
1	#	But I thought things were going great.
1	#	Did she say why?
1	#	But that's your routine.
1	#	So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends it? You really think she would be that superficial?
1	#	Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating the ice cream on TV.
1	#	Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral place, who withdraws? What's the etiquette?
1	#	I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the breakee. He needs to get on with his life.
1	#	Really.
1	#	Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want to fight that traffic on Friday night.
1	#	Really?
1	#	Okay.
1	#	Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
1	#	Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what are you doing?
1	#	Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?
1	#	Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this uh considered signing? Do you do this when you want the check?
1	#	Really. I know a sign, that's my first sign.
1	#	She reads lips.
1	#	(Puts his hand over his mouth) What?
1	#	(Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.
1	#	(Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm not sure about this.
1	#	(Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
1	#	Uh Laura, George was wondering if...
1	#	So I really had a good time.
1	#	So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
1	#	All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura opens the door and gets out). What? What?
1	#	See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Well "six" and "sex" are close.
1	#	Eh.
1	#	Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
1	#	You're kidding.
1	#	In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.
1	#	I know. It's like X-ray vision.
1	#	Can't do it Newman.
1	#	It's not going to happen.
1	#	Uh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
1	#	I said pull over by the stop sign.
1	#	ca.
1	#	You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.
1	#	I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the guy you helped become the first ball man.
1	#	Hey Todd.
1	#	Hi tide?
1	#	No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
1	#	I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
1	#	Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
1	#	I've always been a big fan of the little check move. You know (does the motion for the check) Check, Check. Unless the waiter isn't too shape then you gotta total it up. Sometimes they come over, "Do you want the check?" No I wanna be pen pals, can't you see what I'm doing here? I'm trying to be cool and impress people.
1	#	I told ya. How good is this?
1	#	How good?
1	#	I know it.
1	#	Coffee. And they grind up the coffee beans, and put it in.
1	#	Huh? Huh?
1	#	Suave! And it's non-fat!
1	#	You know, Kramer's gonna clean up on this place.
1	#	He invested in it.
1	#	Yeah. We've been coming here everyday. This is so fuck(bleeped)ing good.
1	#	Oh, I'm sorry.
1	#	Who is it?
1	#	Oh, oh.?
1	#	Hi.
1	#	He's gone, George.
1	#	Oh, man, that yogurt place - you're going to make a fortune.
1	#	They're doing an incredible business.
1	#	How did you know?
1	#	(answering the buzzer) Yeah?
1	#	Hey, I had the show of my life last night. I ad-libbed like ten new minutes.
1	#	(pulling out a tape from his pocket) Vvvvup. Right there. I got it. I did this thing on the Ottoman Empire. Like, what was this? A whole empire based on putting your feet up?
1	#	I'm telling you, I got like a whole new Tonight Show here.
1	#	What's the matter?
1	#	Boy, it's hard to believe - with all that biting experience - a person could still make a mistake like that.
1	#	Kramer!
1	#	Me?
1	#	No.
1	#	I've gained eight.
1	#	How did I gain eight?
1	#	Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that yogurt.
1	#	Well, how else could this have happened?
1	#	What about me?
1	#	Maybe your yogurt isn't so non-fat.
1	#	There must be some kind of lab that would do that kind of thing.
1	#	Well, let's start the insanity.
1	#	And they said they can do it?
1	#	All right. Let's go down to the yogurt store, and we'll get a specimen.
1	#	What?
1	#	Gee, I'm really sorry.
1	#	I'd be happy to.
1	#	Ah, Mary, we've been eating a lot of your husband's uh yogurt at the yogurt place - does that have any fat in it?
1	#	Hello, Newman.
1	#	It was an accident. I'm going to talk to him.
1	#	How's it doing?
1	#	So what.
1	#	Oh, you don't know what you're talking about.
1	#	You call me fatso one more time; you're going to be walking back.
1	#	What do you got there?
1	#	Oh.
1	#	You can't take that chemist out.
1	#	Because she's like the jury. She's going to be sequestered.
1	#	Well, I think the whole thing stinks.
1	#	That's enough.
1	#	With the smelling.
1	#	Uh-huh.
1	#	Well, so, what are you going to do? Sit in the doctor's office doing this? (moves his arm) He's gonna think you're a mental patient.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	No, I believe he can.
1	#	Hi!
1	#	Listen, Matthew, I-I want to explain something to you. Now, cursing is not something that most comedians do.
1	#	That's true. But it was an accident. And I haven't done it since. And I would never do it again. And if you continue cursing, you'll never become a comedian like me when you grow up. (phone rings) Excuse me one second.
1	#	(quickly moves over toward Matthew) What the *beep*(fuck) are you doing? You little piece of *beep*(shit)!
1	#	(surprised) He said that?
1	#	No, but I expect to hear anytime.
1	#	Why do you say that?
1	#	Name tags?
1	#	Oh, I see. So you can go, "Hey, you know who I saw wilding today? Herb!"
1	#	(on the phone) Hello? Yes. Uh-huh. Ya. Oh, really? Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye. (hangs up the phone) Well, the yogurt verdict is in. (Kramer looks at Jerry with his arms out) Fat!
1	#	Look, Elaine, I've been thinking about this. This has got to be a massive conspiracy. Who knows how deep it goes. Hey, look, wait a second, (looking at the TV) Kramer, turn that up.
1	#	Non-fat yogurt? Oh, my god. They got Giuliani and he doesn't even know it.
1	#	Well, we've got to do something. (grabs his phone) I'm calling Giuliani's headquarters.
1	#	The old yogurt was so much better. Oh, this is terrible.
1	#	I can't eat this.
1	#	It had fat in it, it's not good for you.
1	#	So, in effect, the yogurt won him the election.
1	#	The old-fashioned barber shop is unfortunately becoming a thing of the past, now what went wrong? Well first of all there's a twenty thousand dollar chair to make a three dollar tip. I say cut back on the chair, update the magazines. Why do barbers always display that license? There's no laws in hair cutting, except show every person the back of their head that's the one law. I don't want to see the back of my head. Why do I want to see something that I'm never going to see at any other time? When I buy pants two salesmen don't lift me up by the legs and go "how do you like crotch?" If I wanted to see everything I would have been a fly.
1	#	What do you mean that's it?
1	#	"Of course" was the last thing he said?
1	#	"I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a prerequisite."
1	#	So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose the job.
1	#	You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind of company is it?
1	#	Hey
1	#	Shower?
1	#	Oh.
1	#	Who'd you use? Gino?
1	#	Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.
1	#	Really?
1	#	I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
1	#	Okay.
1	#	Oh hi Enzo.
1	#	No, actually I was just gonna...
1	#	Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)
1	#	Well I don't want to take too much off.
1	#	I know.
1	#	What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
1	#	I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd have to pass him every day when I go by.
1	#	I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.
1	#	He was in the shop. I thought you told me he wasn't going to be there.
1	#	I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
1	#	Yea but...
1	#	No, no Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
1	#	I don't want you to call him.
1	#	Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about that?
1	#	Yeah?
1	#	What do you mean you show up?
1	#	Hmm. Not bad.
1	#	Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a large group of people and have to walk out in shame with your tail between your legs.
1	#	Yeah, I see what you mean. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
1	#	So what did you do there all day?
1	#	So it's a nice place to work?
1	#	What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
1	#	Hi.
1	#	I got a haircut.
1	#	Oh there's nothing to see.
1	#	Forget it.
1	#	All right.
1	#	Alright, that's very good. Thank you.
1	#	Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to that bachelor auction.
1	#	Hey
1	#	Yeah, but how am I...
1	#	Oh. thank you.
1	#	Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
1	#	That's nice of you to say.
1	#	In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really good.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
1	#	I think he knew.
1	#	Who do you know? He knows my hair.
1	#	Okay, okay.
1	#	He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost got caught.
1	#	Take the K-man.
1	#	How do you know?
1	#	Who is it?
1	#	All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go out the fire escape.
1	#	What do you want?
1	#	What's wrong with yours?
1	#	You can't unclog it?
1	#	Did you ask Kramer?
1	#	Number one?
1	#	All right. Flush twice.
1	#	All right?
1	#	All right, I'll see you later.
1	#	I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
1	#	Yeah all right.
1	#	You want something to drink?
1	#	If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of a barber.
1	#	I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be like a super hero, like Green Lantern or somebody? What's with this guy? (Gino looks at him annoyed) Just asking.
1	#	Who is it?
1	#	Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling to the door) One second.
1	#	No I wasn't there. (enters and slams the door)
1	#	Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I was just dropping off a book.
1	#	If there's a serial killer lose in your neighborhood, it seems like the safest thing is to be the neighbor. They never kill the neighbor. The neighbor always survives to do the interview afterwards. Right? "Oh, he was kind of quiet." I love these neighbors. They're never disturbed by the sounds of murdering, just stereo. Chain saws, people screaming, fine. Just keep the music down. And all these women who always fall in love with the serial killer. They write to him in prison. Here's a woman that's hard to disappoint. I guess she's only upset when she finds out he's stopped killing people and she goes "You know sometimes I feel like I don't even know who you are anymore".
1	#	No eight years isn't such a long streak.
1	#	No I haven't vomited in thirteen years.
1	#	Not since June 29, 1980.
1	#	Yes, because my previous vomit was also June 29th... 1972. That's why during the '80 vomit, I was yelling to George "Can you believe it? I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
1	#	No Elaine he's normal. Your boyfriend is a normal guy. He just happens to have the same name as one of the worst serial killers in the history of New-York.
1	#	But you like your Joel Rifkin.
1	#	Ask him to change it.
1	#	Why not?
1	#	If someone asked me nicely. I'm Claude Seinfeld.
1	#	Yeah. Eighteen strangles.
1	#	Hey did you hear that George got back with Karen?
1	#	Risotto. (we see a flashback from The Mango where Karen tells George that she feels full after a Risotto, as opposed to when she has sex with him)
1	#	Yeah. He's really got a good thing with her. In fact I'm doubling with them tonight.
1	#	George likes them, he feels it's a good personality showcase. He likes a date to see him with a friend so she can get a window into his nondate personality.
1	#	He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.
1	#	Jody the masseuse.
1	#	No! How many times do I have to go out with her before I get a massage?
1	#	Yeah I know... She just wants to have sex.
1	#	So it's like going to Idhao and eating carrots. I like carrots, but I'm in Idhao, I want a potato.
1	#	(to Jody) My neck is killing me. Right in this spot. Very tender over here.
1	#	(touching the back of his neck) It's like somebody's pulling on wires back here.
1	#	Yeah. Let's go.
1	#	Yeah. Good seeing you again Karen.
1	#	I strained my neck last night.
1	#	I tried brushing my teeth by holding the brush and moving my head from side to side. It didn't work.
1	#	No deal. Why?
1	#	Oh well, he was just showcasing his nondate pesonality.
1	#	Yeah. Sometimes he really makes me tense (he takes Jody's hand and put it on his shoulder)
1	#	Yeah, he's disgusting. (putting her hand back on his shoulder. She unconsciously starts to massage a little while watching TV)
1	#	Yeah, me either. (he takes her other hand and put it on his other shoulder)
1	#	Yeah, he's a bad seed.
1	#	What are you doing?
1	#	Yeah. (disappointed)
1	#	No. The sex was fabulous.
1	#	I want the massage!
1	#	I tried putting her hands there (on his neck) but she pulls it away immediately, she's not into it.
1	#	I guess 'cause it's her job. It's very frustrating.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	She had a good time.
1	#	Pretty much.
1	#	What?
1	#	Yeah (a so-so yeah as he takes a sip of coffee)
1	#	I was blowing on the coffee.
1	#	Look it's not like you're gonna be spending a lot of time with her.
1	#	No.
1	#	Yes.
1	#	Yes.
1	#	"I don't like him."
1	#	Not everybody likes everybody!
1	#	You were very nice!
1	#	It has nothing to do with her sister.
1	#	Oh no. That was the dry heaves.
1	#	Jodi.
1	#	What are you doing here?
1	#	Kramer! (tries to hide he's upset and jealous)
1	#	I'll see you tonight. (he's opening his door apartment as Kramer comes out of his in a bathrobe)
1	#	Who told you to get a massage from her. I haven't gotten a massage from her yet!
1	#	So you had a good time.
1	#	Enjoyed yourself.
1	#	All right now you listen and you listen good! (he grabs Kramer's legs and throws him down the couch)
1	#	The massages are out!
1	#	Ahh!!! They're out!
1	#	Because if I can't get one, you're not getting one.
1	#	I'm sorry, Kramer. (he goes back to the kitchen)
1	#	Don't you ever talk about her like that!
1	#	That's final!!!
1	#	What's the matter with you?
1	#	You just had one yesterday. What do you need another one for?
1	#	Oh please.
1	#	Well, did you get the ball?
1	#	Well, I never even caught a foul ball at a baseball game.
1	#	Why don't you get somebody else?
1	#	Well, that's it! Tonight's the night. I'm getting one. No "if and's or but's".
1	#	(whining like Kramer) Ask Newman.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Ah, no problem. That's fine.
1	#	That's new age music. Sounds of the forest. I find it soothing. Hey, look at this! What do you know? A massage table! This is great! (he starts to install the table)
1	#	Just checking it out. Look at how this thing is made. Can I tell you something? That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
1	#	No, nonsense. This one's fine. (as he sits on the table)
1	#	Go? Why go anywhere? (as he places his hand over hers. She starts to massage his shoulders a little) Ahh, that feels good. Yeah. That's, uh... That's good. (he tries to go further. He grabs her hands over his shoulders and he lies down on the table on his chest) Yeah, that's nice. That's very nice.
1	#	Why, what's wrong? (he grabs her hands and force her to keep them on his shoulders)
1	#	No. Yes you can. (he hangs on)
1	#	Come on! I know it's something you wanna do! (she pulls harder and he falls right off the table)
1	#	What do you mean, no?
1	#	Look, who are you kidding? You come up to my apartment with your table and your little oils, and I'm not supposed to expect anything? You're a massage teaser.
1	#	Fine. Go.
1	#	What for?
1	#	You need to talk?
1	#	George, anything you have to say to her, you can say in front of me.
1	#	What?
1	#	I can see that.
1	#	Don't worry. (she leaves)
1	#	You're a lucky guy.
1	#	George. I wouldn't push for the massage. (George nods)
1	#	The swedish are very big massagers. You know? They like the swedish meatballs, swedish massage. They like having meat in their hands these people, for some reason. But it's weird because they have the highest suicide rate, they're rubbing each other's necks all the time for a neutral country they seem kinda tense. I don't really like the idea of getting a professional massage. I don't want people touching me that don't know me and don't want to have sex with me. You know what are you bothering me for? You get me all loosened up, juices flowing, and then that's it ok, you're done. It's like having chocolate rubbed all over your face, you know you wanna go "Excuse me, I think you missed a spot."
1	#	You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'
1	#	How would you describe the smell in this house?
1	#	Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha?
1	#	Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs, cheap carpeting. It's pot pourri, really.
1	#	You're not allowed to have people over?
1	#	(picks it up) I was having coffee, I put it on the coffee table.
1	#	What's the big rush?
1	#	Who?
1	#	Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?
1	#	(interested) Really?
1	#	Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)
1	#	Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)
1	#	Just put a coffee table book over it.
1	#	There you go. That'll get you home in time.
1	#	I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.
1	#	(handing her a magazine) Here, read this.
1	#	Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something.
1	#	Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?
1	#	What about, what about this thing?
1	#	Yeah. You know, kind of a peace offering. Cute.
1	#	Alright, I'll take it.
1	#	Surprise! (he carries in the object)
1	#	Well, I felt bad about this afternoon, so I got you something.
1	#	Hi. Hi Winona. Nice to see you again.
1	#	I don't need a reason to give gifts, it's my nature. I love to make people happy.
1	#	Are you ready?
1	#	(whips off bag to reveal Indian) Ta-da!
1	#	It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.
1	#	Read it out loud.
1	#	(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.
1	#	Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah.
1	#	...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy.
1	#	She is?
1	#	Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
1	#	Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?
1	#	And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?
1	#	You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.
1	#	I asked because you were the mailman, you would know the neighbourhood.
1	#	I didn't know that...
1	#	I, I had no idea.
1	#	Yeah, did a good job.
1	#	You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.
1	#	Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.
1	#	Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.
1	#	Hello.
1	#	Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.
1	#	Wa, it's two weeks old.
1	#	You collect TV Guide?
1	#	I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste)
1	#	I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.
1	#	Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)
1	#	I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.
1	#	Got 'em on the street, from a scal... (catches himself again)
1	#	A uh, one of those guys.
1	#	You know, the guys, that uh, they sell the tickets for the sold-out events.
1	#	Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.
1	#	Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?
1	#	Thanks.
1	#	So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.
1	#	Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	What'ya do with the one you took?
1	#	I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.
1	#	Where you going?
1	#	My Indian?
1	#	Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.
1	#	Why?
1	#	Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.
1	#	You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)
1	#	A uh, a person that uh...
1	#	Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...
1	#	...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.
1	#	I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.
1	#	I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.
1	#	Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)
1	#	What's the matter?
1	#	It is a good idea, Elaine.
1	#	You want a gyro?
1	#	Elaine!
1	#	I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?
1	#	You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation. But its really like one of the only jobs where you have to have your diploma right up there on the wall. It makes them seem so insecure, doesnt it? "I really am a doctor you know. You think Im not, just check it out." I dont know why they need these little bits of psychological leverage over us all the time. "Go in that little room, take your pants off, wait 15 minutes, and Ill give you my opinion." After that, anyone that comes in with pants on seems like they know what theyre talking about. In any difference of opinion, pants always beats no-pants.
1	#	Then he asked you out?
1	#	On your heart?
1	#	Doctor? Hes a podiatrist.
1	#	Anyone can get into podiatry school. George got into podiatry school.
1	#	Oh hi.
1	#	Yes, Ill be stopping.
1	#	See you later. (to Elaine) Well we cant all be dating podiatrists. (Elaine laughs)
1	#	How did you get in?
1	#	Looks like a swan.
1	#	Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
1	#	Oh, whatever.
1	#	Mmm, succulent.
1	#	To Latvian Orthodox?
1	#	You know its not like changing toothpaste.
1	#	Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
1	#	Oh yeah.
1	#	Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work at it. When I was a kid all the kids would be out playing, I would be up in my room practicing my kissing.
1	#	To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.
1	#	Right there.
1	#	(thinking to himself; picks up a tube) "Fungicide". Fungus?
1	#	Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
1	#	Exactly
1	#	I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I had to go home.
1	#	I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
1	#	I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was no breaking and entering. I wouldnt do that.
1	#	Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
1	#	But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. Theyre knee- deep in fungus. This guy knows fungus.
1	#	What?
1	#	Thats all there is to it.
1	#	And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother Costanza?
1	#	Oh a slinky.
1	#	Why did she give you that?
1	#	What do you mean she liked you?
1	#	You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.
1	#	Yea alright.
1	#	Oh hi.
1	#	(weakly) A little better. (fake cough)
1	#	Okay.
1	#	All right.
1	#	Bye.
1	#	Shes subletting Carols place for a month.
1	#	Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide in her medicine cabinet.
1	#	So I dont know what shes using it for.
1	#	I didnt even think to look.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
1	#	Hi
1	#	Hi. Can I use your bathroom?
1	#	Fine all done, just looking for the soap.
1	#	No I dont see it.
1	#	Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill need that in the form of a question.
1	#	Hey, did you talk to the doctor?
1	#	All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He presents the bottle of fungicide.)
1	#	Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the tube. When are you seeing him again?
1	#	How could you say that?
1	#	I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
1	#	Me too.
1	#	Yes. Hes a doctor. (Elaine starts to leave. ) Wait a second. (Jerry puts the bottle of fungicide in Elaines purse.) (to George) What are you doing?
1	#	(Reading words George wrote on his hand) "Matthew, Luke, Paul", what youre cheating on your conversion chest?
1	#	What?
1	#	Who?
1	#	How do you know?
1	#	Wow
1	#	What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to Kramers door) Ah hah.
1	#	Hey. What are you doing?
1	#	The Kavorka? Whats that?
1	#	What is this thing around your neck?
1	#	You know youre funcifying the whole building.
1	#	Kramer. (knock, knock, knock) Kramer.
1	#	Good. Whats the matter?
1	#	Bonkers?
1	#	Oh its your cat!
1	#	Ooh, nothing.
1	#	Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need the tube back.
1	#	But once you put medicine in your medicine cabinet you're never using it again. Any medicine you're using, is on the sink. It's not really even a medicine cabinet, it's really like an ointment museum isn't it? It's like here's a saff from 1983, some cream from the 70s. But you want to keep it private, because a medicine cabinet is a place that reveals our weaknesses and it can really throw off the balance between two people that might be going out. Somebody peeks in there, "Oh I see Mr. Perfect needs tough actin' Tinactin. Well I guess I'll be calling the shots in this relationship from now on."
1	#	The whale is supposed to be such an intelligent animal. You know you always here about how they can communicate by song from miles away. How extensive their vocabulary is. I would say from the rate we are pushing the whales off the beach back into the ocean the words shore and close do not appear to be in their vocabulary. I would say if the whales concentrate a little less on the singing and a little more on approaching Quervo beach volleyball tournament. If you wanna maintain the brainy mammal image.
1	#	(eating pop corn) hmm I love this artificial flavoring I like it better than butter I think it's more consistent
1	#	what?
1	#	who do you think she is? how dare she? you want me to get the manager? too bad they don't have those old ladies walking around with flashlights anymore we'd flush her out
1	#	I wonder where Elaine is sitting? I really wanted you to meet her she's supposed to be here tonight with her new boyfriend Tony
1	#	hey
1	#	what's the matter with yours?
1	#	It's not one of those 976 calls, is it?
1	#	why do you do that?
1	#	hey where were you last night? I looked for you, I didn't see you
1	#	oh with huh.. pretty boy.. Tony
1	#	hey hey (fooling around with his collar)
1	#	Tony, hey hey (continues fooling)
1	#	huh huh
1	#	no what?
1	#	oh.. whoa..
1	#	well maybe she couldn't spare it
1	#	well, you know, sometimes a square is everything
1	#	Elaine, you cannot judge a person on a situation like that. I mean it's like asking for someone's canteen in the desert
1	#	it's battle conditions
1	#	oh.. Jane she uh.. she uh..
1	#	yeah that should be real fun
1	#	yeah
1	#	(on the phone) hey Andre, get the hell off the phone!
1	#	Kramer's Andre, he's fooling around with these 976 numbers (Kramer walks out of the bedroom) hey I told you, I don't want you doing that on my phone
1	#	hey you know it's weird because that voice sounded a little familiar to me
1	#	no I gotta go downtown
1	#	yeah
1	#	oh uh nothing, she just.. choked on a jujube
1	#	I know, I just can't bring myself to do it meanwhile that freezer keeps getting smaller and smaller (she smiles) (Elaine looks at her watch) oh, don't wanna keep Tony waiting
1	#	hunky.. Tony.. hey hey hey (fools around with his collar again)
1	#	of course you would
1	#	Elaine
1	#	different for a man
1	#	we're expected to be superficial
1	#	Elaine, he's a.. he's a male bimbo, he's a mimbo
1	#	and that's why you're going out with him
1	#	you know, I think George has a non-sexual crush on him
1	#	I mean, every time I see him, it's Tony this, Tony that. George is like a school girl around him
1	#	yeah yeah what is it with you and Tony? what are you? it's like his sidekick now?
1	#	cool guy? what are you, in 8th grade?
1	#	you're making sandwiches?
1	#	(to Kramer) who is it?
1	#	yeah, so?
1	#	did you say flinty?
1	#	oh look at that I got oil all over me. Can I have your napkin?
1	#	you napkin I'm dripping
1	#	I used it up
1	#	you know I'd like to hear about this job of yours
1	#	you're fine (goes to the bathroom)
1	#	just press it
1	#	(coming out from the bathroom) who was it?
1	#	oh..huh.. is she coming up?
1	#	oh.. uh.. you know your breath is a little garlicky you better take some gum.
1	#	Yeah have a couple of pieces, weak, weak gum yeah
1	#	have some more, take some for the road.
1	#	trust me.. nah it's good
1	#	yeah stinks, terrible
1	#	hi Elaine
1	#	this is Jane Elaine
1	#	Saturday night (she leaves)
1	#	I know it's a big problem.. she puts like four pieces in her mouth, it's ridiculous, I don't think we're gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
1	#	well it's too much, it's embarrassing
1	#	she's one of these people, always have to be different
1	#	well
1	#	well aside from that from that, how did he like the sandwiches?
1	#	I've been waiting a while for this. You know it's a shame Tony got all banged up, we're not gonna be able to get together on Saturday night
1	#	yeah, it's a damn shame, a damn shame!
1	#	yeah without a doubt, I'm down (Kramer enters) oh hey how're you doing? Jane this is my neighbor Kramer
1	#	wait, where are you going? where are you going?
1	#	alright I changed my mind, uh yeah I don't think I'm not gonna go now
1	#	Ok.
1	#	See ya. (Jane Leaves; after the door closes Kramer jumps in shock) what's with you?
1	#	who?
1	#	oh you think she's Erika, the phone sex woman
1	#	oh you're crazy
1	#	It's impossible
1	#	it can't be
1	#	alright that's enough
1	#	what?
1	#	oh you're afraid he might look like Zippy the pinhead
1	#	oh I though you didn't care about his looks
1	#	aha
1	#	oh I'm sorry I didn't get most of that.. isn't that Kramer over there?
1	#	hey Kramer
1	#	what's all set?
1	#	how's you get her to meet here?
1	#	oh my god
1	#	hello.. Erika
1	#	how can u say things like that over the phone?
1	#	selling sexual pleasure over the phone?
1	#	paper goods?
1	#	thanks
1	#	Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going "boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly."
1	#	I once got Happy New Yeared in March.
1	#	It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?
1	#	Scary cold.
1	#	That. (pointing at George)
1	#	When did you get that?
1	#	You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?
1	#	Look at this
1	#	Yeah. (pointing at Elaine as he goes into the bedroom)
1	#	The fabric of society is very complex George.
1	#	I tell you George, I don't think we want to walk in there and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi in the middle of the table.
1	#	You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.
1	#	You are. I can't get that thing in my car. (referring to George)
1	#	Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm cold. Just give me a little squeeze.
1	#	You're pretty comfortable up there eh, Bubble boy?
1	#	Jerry.
1	#	Mmm. Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie.
1	#	I love the black and white. Two races of flavor living side by side in harmony. It's a wonderful thing isn't it?
1	#	I'm looking forward to it.
1	#	Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?
1	#	Love that babka.
1	#	So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the cake box.
1	#	I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the little string.
1	#	It's a tad dainty.
1	#	Oh, see that's not fair. We-We were here ahead of all these people.
1	#	Ah, no, forget it.
1	#	Well we saw you come in.
1	#	David!
1	#	Oh so you still don't believe us.
1	#	That's the last babka. They got the last babka.
1	#	That was our babka.
1	#	We had that babka.
1	#	Well what are we going to do now. If we can't get the babka the whole thing's useless.
1	#	Carrot cake? Now w-why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into a cake. I'm sorry.
1	#	Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.
1	#	How about a Napoleon?
1	#	That was our babka. We had that babka!
1	#	Another babka?
1	#	Well-well we got to get the cinnamon.
1	#	I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no babka. People love cinnamon. It should be on tables in restaurants along with salt and pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?" The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. Lesser babka - I think not.
1	#	and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!
1	#	Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.
1	#	Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.
1	#	What?
1	#	Oh, oh take it back. Let's get another one.
1	#	No no come on really, get another one. Itll take a second.
1	#	Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.
1	#	A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
1	#	What if it's your hair?
1	#	Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)
1	#	Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?
1	#	No. Thats out of the question.
1	#	Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
1	#	I'd rather not talk about it.
1	#	All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Well I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.
1	#	My mother's.
1	#	Oh, good.
1	#	Oh, that's lovely.
1	#	Thats what you want to see, yeah. . . . Yeah, you want to trade your hair for some phlegm.
1	#	Yeah thats a good deal -- you win the Pennant with that trade, hair for phlegm.
1	#	Huh, wa?
1	#	I dont know, I don't feel so good.
1	#	My stomach, I , think it was that cookie.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	I think I got David Duke and Farrakhan down there.
1	#	Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.
1	#	I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.
1	#	Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom)
1	#	As good as it gets.
1	#	Oh, no thanks.
1	#	Hey, what happened to your coat? And what is the smell? Is-ya, What are you drunk?
1	#	What for?
1	#	George!
1	#	See ya'.
1	#	I love these nature shows, Ill watch and kind of nature show, and its amazing how you can always relate, to whatever theyre talking about. You know like youre watching the African Dung Beetle and youre going Boy, his life is a lot like mine. And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if its the antelope, and theres a lion chasing the antelope you go, Run antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away! But the next week its the lion, and then you go Get the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, dont let him use his speed!
1	#	Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him Golden Boy.
1	#	Golden Boys always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here... touch Golden Boy!
1	#	But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.
1	#	No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!
1	#	The guy whos in the gulag?!
1	#	You wanna barrow Golden Boy!
1	#	Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"!
1	#	No, no I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"!
1	#	That's were they got it from!
1	#	I'm not joking!
1	#	What?
1	#	Your mother reads your mail?
1	#	What do you mean like post-cards an...?
1	#	She doesn't open...?
1	#	You've caught your mother opening envelopes!
1	#	What did she say?
1	#	Isn't that against the law?
1	#	He can't handle the truth!
1	#	No.
1	#	It's a mammal.
1	#	Yeah, got it from the bank.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	I do.
1	#	I really wanna have fun.
1	#	Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop.
1	#	(he hits a few keys and looks over at her) Cash advance... yes (hits a key)  no (he looks over again) balance inquiry... no (he looks again) receipt.... no (he looks again) processing... processing... (He opens the box, pulls out his money and then looks at the woman and says) I won!
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Oh Diane.
1	#	Good, good.
1	#	Since college.
1	#	Yeah pluggin' along.
1	#	Well he's kind of modest.
1	#	Sure.
1	#	Marine biology.
1	#	Yeah, pretty damn good one, too!
1	#	Yeah... hes specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be."
1	#	Something huh?
1	#	She looked great.
1	#	She asked about you.
1	#	"How's George?"
1	#	Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you.
1	#	I got no problem with that.
1	#	Expect a call.
1	#	Now, I should tell you that, at this point, she's under the impression that youre - a - ah
1	#	A marine biologist.
1	#	Yes.
1	#	I may have mentioned it.
1	#	Yes I know that.
1	#	Why, you don't think it's a good job?
1	#	Oh it's a fascinating field!
1	#	I did it for you.
1	#	You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.
1	#	Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and
1	#	Hey.
1	#	What?
1	#	Well what happened?
1	#	What, what, what's wrong with you?
1	#	Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!
1	#	(to the phone) Hello yeah yes it is really ah, ah Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.
1	#	Shes waking down the street and it hit her in the head!
1	#	Wow.
1	#	Yeah
1	#	Well you have insurance...
1	#	Unbelievable!
1	#	What is with this thing.
1	#	Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.
1	#	Let me have a look at this thing.
1	#	Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.
1	#	I would like to know what my names doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.
1	#	Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!
1	#	Oh, there you are!
1	#	So?
1	#	So what do you have to say for yourself?
1	#	Why should I have anything for say for myself?
1	#	A-Ahahahahah. Who told you?
1	#	You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"?
1	#	Can I take a guess?
1	#	Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?
1	#	Because I know who has it.
1	#	Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!
1	#	I don't have it!
1	#	Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.
1	#	How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?
1	#	Well that's a start.
1	#	You know what room Testikov's in?
1	#	Well, you want your organizer back don't you?
1	#	Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!
1	#	Well you're not Lois Lane.
1	#	Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)
1	#	Oh, here she comes.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Elaine, this is Corinne.
1	#	All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.
1	#	Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)
1	#	Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.
1	#	It was nice meeting you
1	#	youre a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)
1	#	Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)
1	#	Mammal.
1	#	Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!
1	#	Wow! What'd she say?
1	#	All right lets go.
1	#	Ahhh got my laundry back.
1	#	He didn't make it.
1	#	Yea. (pulls at the t-shirt) This is Golden Boy's son Baby Blue.
1	#	Aren't mannequins an insult to your imagination? You couldn't possibly visualize a sweater so we'll show you on this life size snotty puppet. I guess when they finish with them they become crash test dummies. That's the end of the line for a mannequin. "What ever happened to Bob?" "Have you seen that new Volvo commercial? He's got a bulls eye right in his face." Mannequins are only used for car accidents and fashion, I guess these are the two situations that it's impossible for us to imagine ourselves. Well dressed or getting killed. I'm sure there is some pro-mannequin organization that doesn't even like you to use the term mannequin. "Hey they're not mannequins, they're the life deprived."
1	#	Yeah. are you full?
1	#	Ah, here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry starts eating) Mmm, delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some.
1	#	You're not gonna have any?
1	#	Do you not like apple pie?
1	#	Well, at least taste it.
1	#	You won't even taste it?
1	#	Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing "no") A little taste! (still shaking) Come on. (still shaking)
1	#	She wouldn't so much as taste it.
1	#	No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head like this (Imitating Audrey)
1	#	No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.
1	#	The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those moving walkways all over the city.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Tell me about it!
1	#	They could at least try it.
1	#	What's the harm?
1	#	(still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason for her not to taste that pie.
1	#	Audrey.
1	#	Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???
1	#	You did?
1	#	Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?
1	#	(to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the hell's Kramer doing)
1	#	Keep it. (implied please)
1	#	(Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie.
1	#	And you waved it away.
1	#	Did you give her a reason?
1	#	You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your head.
1	#	Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is.
1	#	I think you know my policy.
1	#	No he's going downtown to guard the suit.
1	#	I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts here?
1	#	You've tasted them?
1	#	Oh I see they have apple pie.
1	#	You've had the apple pie?
1	#	Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such a thing would prey on my mind.
1	#	(like a frustrated child) Why can't I know?
1	#	Hello Poppie.
1	#	The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
1	#	Huh?
1	#	No, Nothing.
1	#	So she tought I did it to get back at her
1	#	I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.
1	#	Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. Turn the water on, do something.
1	#	You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's a cry for help, he wants to get caught.
1	#	We haven't spoken.
1	#	Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...
1	#	Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested)
1	#	(very disinterested) Hum... ok, what else you got?
1	#	Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?
1	#	Georgio! Nice duds!
1	#	Did you hear something?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	So what? What would they care?
1	#	So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make a noise?
1	#	You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.
1	#	Audrey?
1	#	Was it apple?
1	#	This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!
1	#	Oh, I got to see this thing.
1	#	Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.
1	#	Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,
1	#	The Charlie Macarthy hearings.
1	#	What are you doing?
1	#	Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.
1	#	I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint gum. Alright, I'm dropping you off at work, right?
1	#	Poppie's
1	#	Hello.
1	#	So how was the pie?
1	#	The apple pie you had today at Monks
1	#	Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.
1	#	Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands)
1	#	Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.
1	#	So you didn't get the job.
1	#	Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have to say something.
1	#	Tell her you lost your itch.
1	#	Well you should tell her.
1	#	No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie away for a long long time.
1	#	It's not good.
1	#	Well at breakfast everybody reads.
1	#	You read during lunch?
1	#	Oh, well.
1	#	Ya, what's there to talk about.
1	#	Why don't you talk to her about how there's nothing to talk about?
1	#	At least you'll be talking.
1	#	Hey, Al.
1	#	Like Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
1	#	Ya.
1	#	Me?
1	#	Ya, see ya.
1	#	(points to George) Ya.
1	#	Could use a good laugh. You know what kind of pressure that is? Come on, come with me.
1	#	Oh, stop it.
1	#	So you're not gonna come?
1	#	Hey! Hey Mick.
1	#	Nothing, what's doing with you?
1	#	George this is Mickey.
1	#	How's work going you guys?
1	#	How do you stop a kid from growing?
1	#	I'm going to the hospital, to visit Fulton.
1	#	Hey, woahoh Fulton. It's me.
1	#	Who couldn't.
1	#	Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.
1	#	Oh, alright ah well... There's a priest, a minister and a rabbi, and they're all staring at him....
1	#	..so uh she's just sitting there and a uh Packyderm, you remember the derm. He says uh, I'm gonna go up to her. So we uh he uh picks up the two pieces of (wipes his brow) pizza and uh the uh and then they're steaming hot and they're burning his hands see so he... he's juggling em (does juggling motions) he's jugglin em, jus throwing them up in the air and just as he gets up to her down they go. (Swallows and takes a breath) Well we all just lost it. (Fulton not laughing, stone faced) It was really really funny.
1	#	Hey Phil how you doing?
1	#	I got my health.
1	#	(wiping his brow) He could use a couple laughs.
1	#	I told it. (Answers the buzzer) Ya?
1	#	Ya. (hits the button, opens the door. To Elaine) Hey you know what as I was leaving I bumped into Phil Titola. He is one of the greatest guys.
1	#	No, but I'll tell you something. Of all the guys I know, I could envision you going out with him.
1	#	If I was a woman I'd be down at the dock waiting for the fleet to come in.
1	#	Alright.
1	#	What?
1	#	So what are you gonna do?
1	#	Why?
1	#	Ya, I could see that.
1	#	No, me either.
1	#	None.
1	#	Fulton's wife told me it's all my fault. She said since my visit he's taken a turn for the worse.
1	#	(yelling) Yes I told him the Packyderm story!
1	#	Towards what end?
1	#	Hey Mick.
1	#	(starts pulling them apart) Alright break it up, break it up. Come on, just cut it out now (Kramer yells)
1	#	(to Mickey) Why does this guy Johnny have it in for you?
1	#	So what does he care if you put lifts in?
1	#	(on phone) Come on Adrian give me another chance, I know I could cheer Fulton up. I'll tell you what, I'll do my act (pauses for response from Adrian) No new material (Elaine enters) He's never heard it. He'll love it, I just did it at the Concord last week, it killed. (waves hello to Elaine; pauses for response from Adrian) Thank you, thanks fo.. you will not regret this. Ok, Bye. (hangs up phone; to Elaine) Hey.
1	#	So?
1	#	Come on. How was your date?
1	#	Ya how was it?
1	#	Really.
1	#	Why what happened?
1	#	Just put it.
1	#	(confused) He what?
1	#	He took what out?
1	#	He took It, Out?
1	#	He couldn't.
1	#	(motions of making out) Well you were involved in some sort of amorous...
1	#	You mean he just
1	#	Are you sure?
1	#	There was no mistaking it?
1	#	So you were talking, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") you're having pleasant conversation, (Elaine makes an agreement sound "mmm") then all of sudden...
1	#	It.
1	#	Out.
1	#	Well I, I can't believe this. I know Phil, he, he's a good friend of mine. We play softball together. How could this be?
1	#	It.
1	#	Out.
1	#	Alright I'm going.
1	#	Well how long you are going to keep this up?
1	#	You know George they are doing wonderful things at mental institutions these days. I'd be happy to set-up a meet and greet.
1	#	Yes I do.
1	#	I'm going to the hospital to see Fulton. I'm not even saying hello, I'm going right into material.
1	#	Oh hey Phil.
1	#	Well, y..you showed her who you are.
1	#	Ya, that's the.. last thing you want to see. Well, next to last.
1	#	Ya take it easy.
1	#	(acting like he was walking on stage) Hey how ya doing? Good to be here.
1	#	This guy's belching out vitamins..
1	#	(cont) and this whole justice league, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman. You mean to tell me Superman can't cover everything?
1	#	For crying out loud, He's Superman. (Fulton stops laughing, Jerry's face is stunned) Fulton? (looks at him) Fulton?
1	#	Good morning.
1	#	Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over my side.
1	#	C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!
1	#	No, no, 12-8!
1	#	I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.
1	#	Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll uh try a sport jacket and scarf thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. (Goes into his room, and comes back out with the jacket on.) Ahh, haven't worn this one in a long time.
1	#	No, gore-tex. It's new. (Checks his pockets.) Hey, look at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look at that.
1	#	No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. Maybe we should ask him.
1	#	Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
1	#	Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.
1	#	But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one step from the couples who dress alike.
1	#	Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. (They go out into the hallway and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.) Hey, how ya doin.'
1	#	Hey, is that my maple syrup? Oh, ya. (Kramer hands it over.)
1	#	Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get in the pocket?
1	#	Oh, wow.
1	#	Oh, come on!
1	#	It's silly!
1	#	Get outta here!
1	#	Oh...yeah...uh you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.
1	#	You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...
1	#	Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...(hugs Meryl.) I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!
1	#	Pardon?
1	#	Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.
1	#	Adoring? What about handsome?
1	#	Ya sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? (Meryl laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.)
1	#	I, uh...well...
1	#	Well, I-I-I told my wife not to bring it.
1	#	No, just Meryl.
1	#	Because she's my wife! (The door buzzer sounds; Jerry answers it) Yeh?
1	#	(buzzes her up) Eh. (to Kramer) You know and I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin a sentence.
1	#	See?
1	#	Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking all your dry-cleaning in!
1	#	Alright. (Elaine enters.)
1	#	The fly-boy.
1	#	Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.
1	#	Hmm, So?
1	#	Really.
1	#	Ohhh, moisture?
1	#	That's an open-lip kiss, alright.
1	#	I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.
1	#	Yeah, so?
1	#	Here we go.
1	#	No, never.
1	#	Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool of someone else's urine?
1	#	Hello.
1	#	What are you doing here?
1	#	Oh. (Smiles at Marty nervously.) Well, I must have been in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. (Hands over Kramer's quilt.)
1	#	Uncle Leo?!
1	#	Hello.
1	#	Uh...I got married.
1	#	Well, it was sudden.
1	#	No, no, it was a small ceremony.
1	#	Yes, yes, you have.
1	#	You did, you did.
1	#	I'm a good printer.
1	#	Uncle Leo, wait!
1	#	Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.
1	#	I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
1	#	Listen, Ma...
1	#	Mom, I'm not married.
1	#	I'm not married!
1	#	I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.
1	#	Well, whoopie whoop. (Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer staggers in the door in his bathrobe.)
1	#	Yeah. (Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto the kitchen floor.) I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are you so tired?
1	#	What is that? (Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.)
1	#	That?
1	#	Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.
1	#	I Love you.
1	#	Goodnight. (They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from each other and go to sleep.)
1	#	(still watching tv; sounds like basketball) Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
1	#	Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?
1	#	Alright.
1	#	Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!
1	#	Hello? Oh, hi honey. (annoyed, weary) Yes, I told him. I'll get it. (George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry to argue with Meryl on the phone.) Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...
1	#	He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.
1	#	Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.
1	#	Where you goin'?
1	#	I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad for ya.
1	#	I'm goin' home.
1	#	I want to!
1	#	Give me the clothes.
1	#	Oh, the hell with her. (Paula dramatically flees from the coffee shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her on the street.)
1	#	I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
1	#	Do you want box or hanger?
1	#	I'm sorry.
1	#	It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.
1	#	Yes, that's right.
1	#	I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
1	#	No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a pretend marriage.
1	#	It's alright, I want you to have it.
1	#	We'll always have...pancakes.
1	#	You know their timing couldn't be worse.
1	#	You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm getting a little uh backed up.
1	#	Not for another three days.
1	#	She lives with her parents.
1	#	(sarcastically) Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will all be turning your way.
1	#	The baldies
1	#	That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.
1	#	Hey Alec
1	#	What happened?
1	#	(acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone like me? Please?
1	#	Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy now?
1	#	Ya, it's much better isn't it?
1	#	Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one of those French-English dictionaries.
1	#	What?
1	#	Yea?
1	#	What about little Joey?
1	#	Ah, I think he's probably better off.
1	#	He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.
1	#	Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
1	#	Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you could get some there.
1	#	(watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?
1	#	Where'd you get plans?
1	#	(walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
1	#	So what plans do you have?
1	#	So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
1	#	Really? Since when?
1	#	Why?
1	#	No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.
1	#	Ya?
1	#	U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a problem with her do you?
1	#	She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.
1	#	He's nice, bit of a close talker.
1	#	You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about the Costanzas'
1	#	No I haven't.
1	#	I'm swamped.
1	#	Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
1	#	Ok buh bye. Have a good time.
1	#	Ok.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
1	#	Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.
1	#	(dialing) He got em out of the house.
1	#	Call Rachel.
1	#	(on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! (hangs up the phone very disappointed)
1	#	(disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi.
1	#	Oh sure like Monet.
1	#	Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.
1	#	(answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.
1	#	Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs phone up)
1	#	Bye
1	#	The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
1	#	This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
1	#	N-na I'm paying for the trip.
1	#	He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
1	#	Ah come on.
1	#	No I haven't seen it yet.
1	#	I'm going
1	#	Ok
1	#	What are you talking about?
1	#	Look I don't know.
1	#	Oh they were tired it was a last minute thing.
1	#	That's right.
1	#	Absolutely
1	#	These the people you currently live with?
1	#	Uh huh
1	#	Look I really don't know what they're plans are.
1	#	What is that anyway?
1	#	I-I'll tell 'em
1	#	Name it.
1	#	So you thought as long as they're mailing postcards, it wouldn't be too much to ask my parents to drag a child who they've never seen, through the streets of Paris?
1	#	(stopping them) We better not. (they make out some more; then stop) T-They're gonna be here any second.
1	#	In two days.
1	#	I know.
1	#	Right, Thursday three o'clock.
1	#	Oh Hi.
1	#	(tucking in his shirt) Oh ya this is Rachel.
1	#	What other time?
1	#	Where you goin'?
1	#	You don't have a car.
1	#	Come on stop.
1	#	(interrupting) No no it's ok. (walking Rachel out) So we'll go see Schindler's List later right?
1	#	Ok. Uh
1	#	Ok, see you later.
1	#	What show?
1	#	When did you get tickets to see that?
1	#	Oh (laughing) Elaine really? Well that sounds interesting.
1	#	Oh.
1	#	Oh
1	#	(answering phone) Hello?
1	#	Yea.
1	#	Oh hi Jack.
1	#	As soon as is humanly possible.
1	#	Yea yea ya I shoulda kept it.
1	#	Ya he's right here.
1	#	What did I do?
1	#	(in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three o'clock.
1	#	(in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all this done in time?
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Oh, really good, really good.
1	#	Like that (snaps his fingers)
1	#	Ya that was some list.
1	#	(confused) The black and white.
1	#	Oh yea, I didn't even realize.
1	#	Ya ya, I tell ya I could see it again.
1	#	It is a tad askew.
1	#	I've hardly been out to dinner with them.
1	#	You're right he's insane.
1	#	So what are you going to do?
1	#	Uh from what I saw it was pretty good.
1	#	Well I um I didn't ah actually get to see the whole movie.
1	#	I was kind of um (pauses) making out.
1	#	I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone in a long time, it just got the better of me.
1	#	(trying to justify it) We're both living with our parents.
1	#	No I don't think so. I saw Newman as I was leaving but see me.
1	#	Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on the counter at which point his parents are both right by him as he goes into the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then turns around to see his parents right there) What? What did I do?
1	#	How could I what?
1	#	What? No.
1	#	(turns) Newman.
1	#	I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone together in a long time and we just kinda started up a little during the coming attractions and the next thing we knew, the war was over.
1	#	(answering the phone) Hello.
1	#	Hang on a second. (handing Morty the phone) Dad it's Klompus.
1	#	Tomorrow afternoon?
1	#	W-what do you mean you're not making the flight?
1	#	You want the tickets?
1	#	You're gonna take this kid to Paris?
1	#	You know I'm paying for these tickets.
1	#	Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right carousel?
1	#	Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting on the carousel next to an open box) isn't that one of yours?
1	#	(turns around noticing the Charter flight) Dad isn't that your charter group?
1	#	Take care
1	#	Buh bye.
1	#	I think she meant me, but.
1	#	Ok.
1	#	Bye.
1	#	You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.
1	#	Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?
1	#	Why what did I do?
1	#	Rachel!
1	#	Rachel!
1	#	So my parents get home, they open the door, my father flicks the light on, the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
1	#	The broken window, Klompus never fixed it. They just walked right in.
1	#	Yea they're taking one, the travel agent is trying to set something else up for them.
1	#	Whew
1	#	No I hadn't noticed.
1	#	(hearing Newman turns and sees him) Hiya Newman.
1	#	Say, I happened to catch you coming out of Schindler's List the other night.
1	#	Yes I was.
1	#	Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?
1	#	Yes, well that was nothing.
1	#	Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) "Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."
1	#	You don't know? Come on, that's gold!
1	#	Oh, that's gold, baby.
1	#	I was saying 'baby' way before George!
1	#	Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.
1	#	He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly . I would like to have a good show.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!
1	#	Hey, Ronnie.
1	#	(To bartender) Can I have a club soda? (To Ronnie) Goin' on tonight?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah, I know.
1	#	(looking at his nostrils) I don't...think so.
1	#	I don't...I dunno.
1	#	Oh, is this a bit?
1	#	(turns to greet Kramer) Hey.
1	#	Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf now, too.
1	#	Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.
1	#	Good, good.
1	#	Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	O.k., good, I'll see you later. (Kramer and Toby are about to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.)
1	#	Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
1	#	Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.
1	#	...that's why men hunt and women nest.
1	#	Yea, ya, so...anyway what was I talking about.
1	#	Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!
1	#	Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!
1	#	Hey! What is wrong with you?!
1	#	Y-You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout the whole set!
1	#	No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!
1	#	Oh, I can take it.
1	#	Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?
1	#	Really? Her mother.
1	#	You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
1	#	Hmm. So you feel "women and children first," in this day and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.
1	#	So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.
1	#	Yeah, well, it's honest.
1	#	Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll see things differently.
1	#	So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?
1	#	By the way, did you see this? (Hands George a magazine)
1	#	It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.
1	#	I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
1	#	Yeah, right.
1	#	Yeah, that'd be something.
1	#	But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always had a fantasy about doing that.
1	#	Why can't I?
1	#	You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where I work, I'll go down to where she works!
1	#	There's no precedent, baby!
1	#	Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'
1	#	Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?
1	#	Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!
1	#	Boo!
1	#	Hiss!
1	#	Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste of her own medicine! (George enters.)
1	#	Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.
1	#	You kept makin' all the stops?
1	#	She got the promotion?
1	#	Why?
1	#	Too bad.
1	#	Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the home.'
1	#	I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to write another article.
1	#	Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!
1	#	Yeah well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.
1	#	Yeah, well, it won't be long.
1	#	Gotta go. (heads out on stage)
1	#	I mean, Bozo the Clown...I mean does he really need "the clown" in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...
1	#	...that's why men hunt and women nest.
1	#	George - could I have a word?
1	#	Kramer, I've driven to east Hampton many times, I know the exit.
1	#	(To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
1	#	Didn't they just have a baby?
1	#	Is it possible they're just having babies to get people to visit them?
1	#	No.
1	#	No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and Jane should be almost there by now.
1	#	I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she signed a letter of intent.
1	#	She's makin' the three o'clock train.
1	#	I bought him some kishka.
1	#	It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry it. In case they're captured behind enemy lines, they eat it and it kills them.
1	#	Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?
1	#	No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.
1	#	No thanks.
1	#	And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
1	#	No lines.
1	#	So when are we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous event?
1	#	(Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.
1	#	Jane's topless. (They all look)
1	#	Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
1	#	Oh, in a minute, Carol.
1	#	This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
1	#	Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as Jane enters)
1	#	No thanks.
1	#	So very gorgeous.
1	#	Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
1	#	Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They sit) And, you know, the thing is, they're never gonna know, no one's ever gonna tell them.
1	#	It's a must lie situation.
1	#	You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane topless.
1	#	In fact remind me to tell Kramer too.
1	#	Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.
1	#	Okay. (He leaves)
1	#	Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes outside)
1	#	She's got greeting problems.
1	#	Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup and the sauce, but you can't find a good one. (Kramer enters with a box of lobster)
1	#	You got lobster for everybody?
1	#	(Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
1	#	Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.
1	#	No.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
1	#	Well what'd you mean?
1	#	They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
1	#	(looking of into the distance) I guess that's true...
1	#	What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
1	#	You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
1	#	I've never been called breathtaking either.
1	#	Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
1	#	How are you gonna do that?
1	#	You might have.
1	#	You won't.
1	#	Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?
1	#	Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.
1	#	Wait'll you get to know him.
1	#	Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything quite so objectionable. It's down the hall, third door on your left. (Rachel walks down hall, walks in on George changing out of his swimsuit)
1	#	It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.
1	#	So what?
1	#	But...
1	#	Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
1	#	So you feel you were short changed.
1	#	Well, so what's the difference?
1	#	Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
1	#	Women aren't like us.
1	#	No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.
1	#	Isn't it common knowledge?
1	#	Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
1	#	Like a frightened turtle!
1	#	No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.
1	#	Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.
1	#	(To George) Easy big fella.
1	#	You told her?
1	#	You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.
1	#	Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle of the night. (Rachel shocked)
1	#	(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs like this?
1	#	Well, I guess I gotta go, too.
1	#	I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
1	#	They got some sort of program.
1	#	Hey, isn't that Michael's car?
1	#	You got a raise?
1	#	I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
1	#	Oh, when did that happen?
1	#	Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee table book?
1	#	Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're back with Jake Jarmal.
1	#	Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen "Girlie" Brown would be very proud of you.
1	#	Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
1	#	Oh, the beach.
1	#	What is it that isn't working?
1	#	(pointing to napkins; to Elaine) Could I get napkin over there?
1	#	You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon is the opposite of tuna, 'cuz salmon swim against the current, (hand motion of the salmon swimming against the current) and the tuna swim with it. (hand motion of the tuna swimming with it)
1	#	Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.
1	#	If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.
1	#	(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)
1	#	What's happening?
1	#	Oh yeah, I heard all about it.
1	#	You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
1	#	I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
1	#	What're you gonna talk about?
1	#	Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye. (hangs up the phone; turns to Kramer) You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes later get another, same weekend, same money.
1	#	(shocked) Broke even.
1	#	So it's all over?
1	#	And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
1	#	Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
1	#	Played cards last night.
1	#	Broke even.
1	#	Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. It never fails! I always even out!
1	#	What for?
1	#	(shocked) What the hell was that?
1	#	You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.
1	#	Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.
1	#	Bad.
1	#	So you just did the opposite of everything?
1	#	So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
1	#	Elaine ... look! A twenty!
1	#	I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.
1	#	Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.
1	#	Yes?
1	#	Uh huh?
1	#	Oh, that's okay.
1	#	Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.
1	#	Sure. See, things always even out for me.
1	#	It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for a while. And uh good luck!
1	#	(leaving; singing) She'll be coming around the mountain...
1	#	The New York Yankees?!
1	#	Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?
1	#	I can't believe it.
1	#	Ya?
1	#	(buzzes Elaine up) Come on up.
1	#	That's a great place!
1	#	George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.
1	#	Hi Elaine.
1	#	How're things going?
1	#	Why? Why are they doing that?
1	#	The jewel thief?
1	#	What else?
1	#	Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?
1	#	Is that the end of it?
1	#	Alright.
1	#	He knows what he's doing.
1	#	Opposite.
1	#	Why'd you have to eat so many?
1	#	Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
1	#	Don't say that.
1	#	Ah ... let's call it even.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	That's alright, I got it.
1	#	Elaine, stop it.
1	#	I'm sorry.
1	#	Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?
1	#	Right, just like you.
1	#	Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...
1	#	I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.)
1	#	Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.
1	#	And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.
1	#	The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.
1	#	No, it's part of the contest rules.
1	#	I don't know, she just sits there.
1	#	I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.)
1	#	Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?
1	#	Of course, they're polyester.
1	#	Why do they wear polyester?
1	#	You're going to do something about it?
1	#	Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?
1	#	I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?
1	#	Rhode Island.
1	#	Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.
1	#	Congratulations!
1	#	Now, what is it that you do, exactly?
1	#	Like what?
1	#	Really! Socks!
1	#	Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)
1	#	Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you know what I mean.
1	#	What?
1	#	I'm not going to "defile" her!
1	#	But -
1	#	But wait a minute...
1	#	That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -
1	#	Alright, Kramer!
1	#	Hey, come on!
1	#	I'll be right back. (Leaves the table.)
1	#	Well, here we are...
1	#	Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.
1	#	And that waist cincher, that was the topper!
1	#	Yes, I poo-poo.
1	#	I don't want to stop her!
1	#	Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)
1	#	See what?
1	#	Boy, they really do sound comfortable.
1	#	I'm working in Atlantic City.
1	#	Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?
1	#	You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...
1	#	Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?
1	#	Hey Elaine, it's me.
1	#	We're going to Atlantic City.
1	#	Today, right now! Are you in?
1	#	Why not?
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Good. How was the roulette?
1	#	Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!
1	#	What the hell is that?
1	#	Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.
1	#	What? Why? What happened?
1	#	Birds?
1	#	What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.
1	#	No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!
1	#	Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)
1	#	Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.
1	#	I heard those doves were really incredible.
1	#	It's like watching an animal get tortured.
1	#	Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)
1	#	That's a shame.
1	#	Why did you give him MY number?
1	#	I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
1	#	Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
1	#	Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.
1	#	Hi Julie.
1	#	Just had a big bowl of Kix.
1	#	Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.
1	#	Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
1	#	People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
1	#	It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.
1	#	I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
1	#	What was that?
1	#	Certainly are.
1	#	All right. You're in MY face.
1	#	(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.
1	#	He doesn't even care if a man answers.
1	#	Bye bye
1	#	Well, that all depends. . .
1	#	Yeah, so?
1	#	Is that a fact?
1	#	No it isn't.
1	#	Yes you did.
1	#	She could have.
1	#	Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.
1	#	Obviously.
1	#	What?
1	#	Well, it has nothing to do with you.
1	#	Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.
1	#	And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
1	#	Ah, no , I don't think so.
1	#	We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
1	#	Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.
1	#	Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.
1	#	Hello Newman.
1	#	No, no I don't. Why?
1	#	I suppose.
1	#	I don't know. Nothing.?
1	#	You two know each other?
1	#	. . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
1	#	Why?
1	#	You liked, Newman?
1	#	No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.
1	#	. . . HE ended it?
1	#	No, no of course not.
1	#	What tee?
1	#	Newman! She went out with Newman!
1	#	No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?
1	#	No, there's less.
1	#	No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.
1	#	Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.
1	#	No,, but thank you.
1	#	Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.
1	#	No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor and got it.
1	#	Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.
1	#	Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.
1	#	Hi Julie.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.
1	#	How do you know THAT?
1	#	It's Jerry.
1	#	Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!
1	#	Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?
1	#	No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little rat's nest. Now, what happened?
1	#	Noit your type?
1	#	Well, how come?
1	#	What, what is wrong with her?
1	#	You don't think she's attractive?
1	#	Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.
1	#	No, thank you.
1	#	But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
1	#	What are you so worried about this for?
1	#	He did?
1	#	So it had nothing to do with you.
1	#	No, I don't think so.
1	#	Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I like that.
1	#	Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?
1	#	Yeah,, me too.
1	#	Where you going?
1	#	You're going to see Genderson?
1	#	You had how many dates with him? Three?
1	#	And . .
1	#	What? I'm not looking. Nothing.
1	#	Why are you looking at my face?
1	#	Where am I going to look?
1	#	. . . I can't.
1	#	Newman!
1	#	All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.
1	#	You're going out with the stationery store guy?
1	#	Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
1	#	Your friend, Noreen.
1	#	If I was flattering myself, I think I'd come up with someone a little less annoying than Noreen.
1	#	If you don't believe me, ask her.
1	#	Oh, right. The guy who talks with a really high voice.
1	#	Check the pile.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Oh.
1	#	Isn't that cute, a 'thank you' card from Kristin.
1	#	She works for PBS, I met her when I agreed to do that pledge drive.
1	#	Yeah, in fact she said that you could be one of those people that sits in the back and answers the phone.
1	#	No, it's not aluminum siding, it's volunteer work. All the money goes to the station.
1	#	Yeah, and one of those foam beer can holders.
1	#	Oh, go ahead.
1	#	Like she's really going to admit she was flirting with me.
1	#	So was I right? She likes me, right?
1	#	I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis at PBS. Show us you care. Call in your pledge now.
1	#	Oh, I know you are.
1	#	I did.
1	#	What?
1	#	No?
1	#	Well--
1	#	You signed your name and you addressed the envelope, it's not like you painted the picture and wrote the poem.
1	#	Why, because I threw the card out? How long was I supposed to save it?
1	#	I have sentimentality, really, I'm sentimental. Here, look. Here's some cards I've saved, these are birthday cards from my grandmother, see, I'm not a bad guy.
1	#	(as Kristin is storming out) Well, but, you see, I saved something! See? I can save. I'll see you at the pledge drive, ok?
1	#	No, they're old cards from my grandmother.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah, she puts ten dollars in every card for my birthday, that's why I save them.
1	#	I don't know, it's ten dollars.
1	#	Oh so what.
1	#	Oh, get out of here.
1	#	Alright, alright, I'll cash the checks.
1	#	It was a 'thank you' card from Kristin because I'm doing the PBS drive. I mean, how long am I supposed to keep it?
1	#	You making that up or do you know what you're talking about?
1	#	I mean really, what's the point of saving it? I could see if I had a mantel.
1	#	Absolutely.
1	#	So anyway, she's kind of upset about it so I need you to do me a favor.
1	#	Well, I'm doing the PBS show, so during the show they're gonna be running the Ken Burns baseball thing. So I thought if I could get a baseball player to come on the show with me...
1	#	Could you?
1	#	Alright, Do your thing, where you lie to everyone.
1	#	Hey, did you ever get to talk to Noreen?
1	#	So was I right about the flirting? Was it true?
1	#	Remember when we were in the bookstore, that woman came up to us?
1	#	Oh, sure she was; Asked me where the 'humor' section was? Humor? Come on.
1	#	Alright, so maybe she wasn't flirting with me. So what?
1	#	Why does he do that?
1	#	Oh, you know.
1	#	That's how waitress types express derision. They don't want to get their mouths dirty.
1	#	Okay, sixty bucks from Nana.
1	#	You got Danny Tartabull?!
1	#	Boy, you really came through. Kristin's gonna be thrilled.
1	#	Excuse me?
1	#	You're just answering phones!
1	#	Uh, say, I wanted a side order of fruit but I didn't see it on the men
1	#	Right you are.
1	#	Oh, she had an itch.
1	#	By the way, lunch is on me. I just cashed my Nana's birthday checks.
1	#	(answering) Hello?
1	#	Uncle Leo!
1	#	Nana's missing?
1	#	I've been thinking about her, I just cashed some of her checks.
1	#	I think Chemical Bank.
1	#	Well, Kramer thought it would make her happy. (To Kramer) I never should have cashed those checks!
1	#	Just call me if you hear anything. (hangs up and faces Kramer) Well? I cashed the checks, the checks bounced and now my Nana's missing!
1	#	It's your fault!
1	#	Would you?
1	#	No.
1	#	Yeah, my grandma's missing.
1	#	Yeah. I think it might have something to do with those checks.
1	#	Like a grandmother, why?
1	#	Oh, you hung up on my Nana?!
1	#	You told Nana to drop dead?!
1	#	Yes, it is!
1	#	Alright.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Leo?
1	#	Uncle Leo! What are you doing here?
1	#	Oh.
1	#	He'll be here any second.
1	#	Yeah, yeah.
1	#	No, that's ok, I really don't need any money.
1	#	Please-
1	#	It's not necessary.
1	#	I can't, I can't take it.
1	#	Uncle Leo, I don't want to have it!
1	#	I don't want it!!
1	#	You know what? It sounds like the friend of Elaine's that was hitting on me in the book store.
1	#	I'm Jerry Seinfeld, I tell jokes for a living, but there's no joking about the financial crisis here at PBS. Our lines are open, so please call the number you see on your screen.
1	#	This is the only time this year we'll be asking for donations. You've been enjoying Ken Burns' Baseball-
1	#	-programs like Ken Burns' Baseball. And if Danny Tartabull were here, I'm sure he'd say, 'That's correct, Jerry.'
1	#	My Nana?
1	#	I got another card from Kristin. Not quite as chipper as the first one.
1	#	Yes, he is.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Look, she's cutting up an Almond Joy.
1	#	You know, I saw someone on the street eating M&Ms with a spoon.
1	#	(surveying the restaurant) Look, they're doing it. They're all doing it!
1	#	(feeling face) Good shave today...
1	#	I'm thinkin' of lettin' my sideburns grow in a little...
1	#	(pause) Yeah, I guess.
1	#	...So how's Noreen?
1	#	Already? That was fast... I assume he's not a High Talker...
1	#	A Long Talker.
1	#	(pause) All right; let's move it out.
1	#	Hey, isn't that George's father?
1	#	I've never seen him in Manhattan before; it's weird. So out of context.
1	#	I believe he is wearing a cape.
1	#	Well, it is good cape weather. Cool. Breezy.
1	#	You're right; it is strange. In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street. Cover me.
1	#	Just, uh, plop it on the counter there.
1	#	Oh! I got a message. (presses button on answer machine)
1	#	Let me call him back... Hello? Who is this? Donna Chang? Oh, I'm sorry, I must o' dialed the wrong number.
1	#	(is redialing) I should've talked to her; I love Chinese women.
1	#	If I like their race, how can that be racist?... Hellooo??... Oh, is this Donna Chang again?!... Yyy-yes, I am calling George... Oh, the lines are crossed! You're getting his calls. Well, what do you know?!
1	#	So listen...
1	#	I got a date!
1	#	She knew who I was! She saw me in a club one time! My first date ever with the Pacific Rim. I'm very excited.
1	#	No, why should I? I wear boxers.
1	#	I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records are permanently sealed...
1	#	Really? You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years??... Boy, I'm surprised. You've slept with a lot of women!
1	#	Well, I'm sure you're not... Totally Depleted.
1	#	So go to a fertility clinic. Have your sperm count checked.
1	#	I am very excited about this date! We're goin' to Hunan Balcony!
1	#	She suggested it!
1	#	She's very assimilated.
1	#	Paul again?
1	#	I tried! Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman!
1	#	No. Jacket and tie no cape.
1	#	Yes, I will.
1	#	No, go ahead, I second-hand smoke two packs a day.
1	#	(pause. Stops tapping his leg) 'scuse me?
1	#	Who are you?
1	#	(stands, puzzled, it's not sinking in) W-what do you mean?
1	#	(pause) You're Donna Chang?
1	#	Oh. No. What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
1	#	I didn't think so.
1	#	No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.
1	#	Well, she's... like you.
1	#	Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as "Donna Chang"...
1	#	Well, she is a woman.
1	#	Really? (sits on couch)
1	#	Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?
1	#	Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?
1	#	Here, what is that?!!
1	#	Wha--you have a low sperm count?
1	#	Nnnoo--I don't want 'em. (starts backing away as Kramer follows him around the room carrying the underwear)
1	#	Look! I don't want 'em!
1	#	I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house!
1	#	(re the underwear pile) Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
1	#	Did they uncross the lines yet?
1	#	(long pause -- did he hear "ridicurous" -- should he say something -- can't decide if he should. Finally...) Did you say, "ridicurous"?
1	#	(pause) I thought you said... "ridicurous." (Donna looks puzzled)
1	#	Oh, what are you doing here?
1	#	The rines are crossed?
1	#	Did I?
1	#	Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.
1	#	Gee, I never thought of that.
1	#	Have you ever spent any time with these people...?
1	#	And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.
1	#	Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...
1	#	You went back to the Jockeys?
1	#	(pause as he realizes) Oh, no.
1	#	Don't you see what's goin' on here???... No boxers, no Jockeys...
1	#	The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine... Kramer, say it isn't so.
1	#	Don't you need a little... help?
1	#	What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!
1	#	First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.
1	#	So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world He's Boring.
1	#	Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman anything you say she does!
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little)
1	#	Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?
1	#	First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.
1	#	Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!
1	#	You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...
1	#	Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine...
1	#	Why? What happened?
1	#	Wow! That's amazing!
1	#	Tonight?
1	#	So I'm curious. What'd you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
1	#	Confucius, huh?
1	#	(pause) You know, you're not Chinese...
1	#	Hey! I heard the good news!
1	#	Elaine was... in a rush.
1	#	(pause, to Donna) You know, you might wanna think about changin' your name...
1	#	Well--Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese. (buys a newspaper out of a machine)
1	#	Yeah, no one's reading any rolled-up messages in a knish...
1	#	Hey.
1	#	So, she got you to join a book club?
1	#	Well, I think that statement alone reflects your burgeoning intelligence. (Sits on a couch.) Hey, what about this one?
1	#	So, what's your first book?
1	#	It's kinda old, isn't it?
1	#	Oh, yeah.
1	#	No. You?
1	#	New couch, baby!
1	#	I love this couch. You know what the best part about it is? It doesn't fold out, so no one can sleep over.
1	#	Wait till you see it, it's perfect. The guy told me it's one of a kind, they stopped making it.
1	#	Nothing, the moving guys are taking it. Why, you want it?
1	#	Well, I'm sure that they can deliver it to your apartment.
1	#	It's here!
1	#	Oh, you mean from Poppie's Restaurant?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	What made you resurrect that old idea?
1	#	I'm not goin' there. Didn't he get busted by the Board of Health?
1	#	Oh, Kramer, I -
1	#	Right there, guys. That's perfect. Ah? Whatta ya think, Lainie?
1	#	Oh no, I don't want anyone sitting on it.
1	#	Uh, no. Should I have?
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Ah ha...
1	#	I can't wait.
1	#	Clever.
1	#	Yes.
1	#	You're something. So anyway, when they were in my house before, I didn't offer them anything to drink.
1	#	So, anyone sweaty comes into your house has to be offered a drink?
1	#	Well, would you apologize for me? (Elaine nods. Poppie comes out of the kitchen.)
1	#	Well, Kramer told us all about your business venture together.
1	#	So, what's good tonight?
1	#	Ah, I could've stayed home and ordered a pizza from Paccino's.
1	#	Why not?
1	#	So, you won't eat the pizza?
1	#	Really.
1	#	Well, what if Poppie felt the same way?
1	#	Really!
1	#	Well, perhaps we should inquire. Poppie! Oh, Poppie. Could I have a word? (Poppie comes over.)
1	#	Poppie, I was just curious...where do you stand on the abortion issue?
1	#	Oh, boy.
1	#	Well, I'm certainly glad I brought it up. (Gets up and leaves.)
1	#	Well, you should have seen it. It was quite a scene over there.
1	#	Oh, you really missed something. And I have to say...it was pretty much all my fault. (Jerry smiles. George laughs.) So, how's the book coming? (George's laughs taper off...) I say, how's the book comin'?
1	#	So, what's it about?
1	#	Holly Go-Lightly.
1	#	Yes, you haven't read a page, have you?
1	#	Big surprise.
1	#	You're not very bright, are you?
1	#	Why don't you rent the movie?
1	#	Oh...well...
1	#	We should get him something.
1	#	Whoa!
1	#	Did you tell him I was sorry I didn't offer him the drink?
1	#	No games? What is the point of dating without games? How do you know if you're winning or losing?
1	#	Ah ha. And what is his stand on abortion?
1	#	What is his stand...on abortion?
1	#	How do you know?
1	#	Well, you should probably ask, because if he's gonna be coming over with those Paccino's pizzas...could be trouble.
1	#	Hey, what's happenin.'
1	#	You got a regular 'Manhattan Project' going on over there.
1	#	Okay. Hi, Poppie.
1	#	I'm sorry about the gift, I didn't know about your condition.
1	#	Okay. I'll get it. (Goes into the bedroom.)
1	#	...the...the...
1	#	This puddle on my sofa!
1	#	Well, what is it then?! My new sofa! Poppie peed on my new sofa!
1	#	I don't care if it comes out, I can't sit on that anymore!
1	#	You see?!
1	#	Well, I guess I have no choice.
1	#	I was hoping you'd offer. (The intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
1	#	Kay. (Buzzes them in.)
1	#	Your boyfriend, he's taking it out.
1	#	Why?
1	#	Oh, really. (Carl and another moving guy come in and pick up the couch.)
1	#	Hey Carl, I also need you to go to Elaine's and bring my old couch back.
1	#	Could you?
1	#	George is taking it.
1	#	He said he doesn't care, he'll just turn the cushion over.
1	#	I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money down the toilet, but look how close I am!"
1	#	I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" thing.
1	#	As we all do.
1	#	Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?
1	#	You're good with the mothers.
1	#	Maybe you should date the mothers.
1	#	Oh, you got something goin'.
1	#	What do you need a hammer for?
1	#	Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.
1	#	Nah, I don't think so.
1	#	Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?
1	#	Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?
1	#	Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.
1	#	Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.
1	#	Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just a sexual dalliance.
1	#	She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?
1	#	(watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
1	#	(stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was it doing off?
1	#	(laughing) What for?
1	#	Unbuttoned, or all the way off?
1	#	Of course.
1	#	What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should see the doctor and have it checked out.
1	#	(picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt off?
1	#	Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.
1	#	(trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've been some dictator.
1	#	He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"
1	#	No, you'd have to be crazy.
1	#	Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.
1	#	So lemme get this straight you find yourself in the kitchen. You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What the hell, I'll just eat some trash."
1	#	Was it in the trash?
1	#	Then it was trash.
1	#	But it was in the cylinder!
1	#	Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.
1	#	Was it eaten?
1	#	Well, that's garbage.
1	#	Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and Bum. You are now a Bum.
1	#	Hey!
1	#	What's with you?
1	#	What stone?
1	#	What is that, anyway?
1	#	Oh, that's gotta hurt.
1	#	Good for you.
1	#	Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it out.
1	#	Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what they do. It's not going to make any difference.
1	#	Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having to consider people's feelings.
1	#	No.
1	#	No.
1	#	Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's better than eating it.
1	#	All right.
1	#	(pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!
1	#	(smiling and excited) Well, here we are.
1	#	How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, it's only this wide!
1	#	Oh boy...
1	#	I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, there was nothing gymnastic about it.
1	#	Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.
1	#	Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...
1	#	You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of specifics...
1	#	Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like the apparatus.
1	#	See, again, I really don't feel that...
1	#	Could we stop?
1	#	All right. Let's just drop it.
1	#	So lemme ask you this how long would you say I have to put in now because of, you know, last night.
1	#	(sarcastic) Oh, great.
1	#	Between Poland and Morgan?
1	#	Kramer! The stone!
1	#	What happened, did you pass the stone?
1	#	Strike two!
1	#	You're behind in the count.
1	#	I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.
1	#	If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.
1	#	We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.
1	#	Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!
1	#	Yeah, well you're going.
1	#	"Greatest Show on Earth"!
1	#	Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.
1	#	Well, break a leg.
1	#	Eh, show biz...
1	#	Boy, those capes are really coming back.
1	#	What is that sound?
1	#	Oh, why not?
1	#	Really?
1	#	Ill have the, ah, turkey club without the bacon.
1	#	She does have a way.
1	#	Well they do work on tips.
1	#	Ah, I should have got the egg white omelet.
1	#	The omelet. Damn.
1	#	No.
1	#	Not possible.
1	#	Lannie, how was the trip?
1	#	Yeah, well that relationships really got a lot of potential.
1	#	Oh no, it's Kenny Bania.
1	#	(quietly) Oh, he's this awful comedian.
1	#	Hey Kenny. (with some fake enthusiasm, just to be polite)
1	#	Elaine, George (introducing them to Bania with less enthusiasm)
1	#	How's it going?
1	#	No kidding.
1	#	All right.
1	#	Ahh, Im a 40. Why?
1	#	Well I don't know if I ...
1	#	Well ... ok, I guess (voice trailing off)
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah, yeah, lucky me. (sips coffee)
1	#	Well, go in there and talk to her. She's not going to put em on the glass.
1	#	Pull yourself together. Your going in there soldier! That's an order!
1	#	Get in there. (he pushes George in the direction of the restaurant)
1	#	Hey.
1	#	What?
1	#	Why?
1	#	YEAH? (speaking loudly so the visitor can hear him through the intercom)
1	#	ALL RIGHT, COME ON UP (Jerry puts his head down - he's not looking forward to Kenny Bania)
1	#	Well, well, why are you getting rid of your refrigerator? (he gets up from the table and carries a dish into the kitchen)
1	#	What for?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yes, yes, I heard.
1	#	No, it's ok.
1	#	All right, all right. (trying on the suit jacket)
1	#	Ok, Yeah all right.
1	#	Yes, yes, he is.
1	#	Dinner?
1	#	Yeah, Ill see you.
1	#	Yeah, that's a deal. That's a terrible deal. I don't want to go out to dinner with him. Id rather make my own suit.
1	#	Hey. (raises hands into fists of encouragement)
1	#	I love the day date. No wine, No shower.
1	#	So you just pretended it didnt bother you?
1	#	Boy, It's the way they just slip it in there too.
1	#	Well let me ask you this. What exactly did you say when you asked her out?
1	#	Oh, a walk, well --
1	#	Or something. Yeah, that's a date.
1	#	Course you know there is always the possibility, that she called an audible.
1	#	Well she got up to the line of scrimmage, didnt like the looks of the defense and changed the play.
1	#	Uh huh.
1	#	You did?
1	#	Yeah. You said you liked horse manure.
1	#	(quietly) Mm-hm.
1	#	And it was around this point that she mentioned the boyfriend?
1	#	Im just saying there's a chance she may not have been enamored with your thoughts and feelings on manure.
1	#	My honest opinion, I think she made it up.
1	#	Aaa. Well ... you want something to eat, don't you?
1	#	Well Im glad it's working out.
1	#	Boy, if I could meet a hostess, we could open up our own place.
1	#	Is she?
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Oh, Hi.
1	#	Yeah, you wanna get that meal, don't you?
1	#	No I haven't?
1	#	All right.
1	#	(hangs up the phone) Yeah, I really needed that suit.
1	#	Mm. That's fantastic. (he could care less)
1	#	No I don't.
1	#	Why?
1	#	No, not yet.
1	#	Ill have the salmon.
1	#	Another time? What other time?
1	#	No, no, Bania, no. This is the dinner. The soup counts.
1	#	Im not stopping you from eating. Go ahead and eat. Get anything you want.
1	#	Then that's the meal.
1	#	I didnt tell you to have a hot dog. Who told you to have a hot dog?
1	#	All right, fine. Get the soup!
1	#	So he just gets soup. He wants to save the meal. So now I got to do it all over again.
1	#	I don't know? Consomm or something.
1	#	What?
1	#	Elaine you're missing the whole point.
1	#	The meal is the act of sitting down with him. It doesn't matter what you get, as long as he's sitting in that restaurant, its a meal.
1	#	You see -- ah, uh ...
1	#	A bowl, ok?
1	#	As a mater of fact, he did.
1	#	It's like Im talking to my Aunt Sylvia here.
1	#	Well, I have some money. What do you need? (pulls out some bills)
1	#	So is she working? Is she here?
1	#	Have you said anything to her?
1	#	Are you going to say anything?
1	#	Ill have an egg white omelet.
1	#	Yeah, that was bad.
1	#	Oh, no, it's Kenny. Slide out so he can't sit down. (George & Jerry each slide to the end of their booth seats)
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Actually, I did. I put it on last night and slept in it.
1	#	... Oh, Im joking.
1	#	Why don't you get a sandwich?
1	#	OK ... (nodding his head up and down) This is it cha know
1	#	This is the meal ... so stock up buddy boy.
1	#	Yes it is. Soup and sandwich. That is a meal.
1	#	I tried to do that.
1	#	Doesn't matter, This is it. This completes the transaction.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Where's Simon?
1	#	When's he leaving? (putting some items into the refrigerator)
1	#	Ah, no thanks.
1	#	(on the phone) Hello? No, Im sorry Bania ... Im not going over this again. Well who told you to order soup? ... No! There's no dinner. There's not going to be any dinner. You've had a sandwich and 2 bowls of soup and that's it. Good-bye.
1	#	Hey, what size suit are you?
1	#	40. Perfect. Brand-new Armani suit, you want it?
1	#	Great, its yours. I can't stand the sight of it. Elaine, heres the car keys. (tosses her the keys)
1	#	Yo?
1	#	I don't have your suit. I gave it away.
1	#	Well it's gone. Im sorry. Good-bye Bania.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Ok.
1	#	Nothing.
1	#	You want food, don't cha? (nodding his head up and down)
1	#	All right, go ahead
1	#	What are we doing out here? Aren't we going to go in and eat?
1	#	Oh, w-what are you saying? So we're not going to go in there anymore?
1	#	We can't eat here anymore, because he took a waitress out for a walk.
1	#	So what's going on with Simon? Did he leave?
1	#	Look at this. They make a point of saying on the menu, No egg white omelets. Look at that.
1	#	Oh, hi Hilde. Can I get an egg white omelet?
1	#	All right, just give me a western. (unhappy)
1	#	Not fair.
1	#	She's on your turf.
1	#	You're the best.
1	#	Well as I see it, you've got to apply the same principles that get you fired, but redirected, outwardly.
1	#	Well, there's nothing left. There's no food.
1	#	Why'd she get fired?
1	#	Boy, he's a real bounder, isn't he?
1	#	I don't have it. You want half my omelet? (holds his omelet plate up to Bania)
1	#	Okay, Tim. You're welcome. (Hangs up.)
1	#	Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?
1	#	Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.
1	#	He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)
1	#	Uh - new car!
1	#	Hey! Did you get the Volvo?
1	#	I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.
1	#	Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.
1	#	You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?
1	#	I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.
1	#	Alright, take 'em.
1	#	I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.
1	#	Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.
1	#	Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.)
1	#	Not all of 'em!
1	#	Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?
1	#	I can't wear these!
1	#	They're uncomfortable.
1	#	I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!
1	#	But I don't wanna be a cowboy!
1	#	Oh yeah? Huh.
1	#	No, nothing.
1	#	No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.
1	#	Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.
1	#	Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?
1	#	C'mon, put the top up, it's November!
1	#	Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.
1	#	With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.
1	#	Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.
1	#	Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?
1	#	Nothing. I'm sure "Jon" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)
1	#	What?
1	#	And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!
1	#	No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.
1	#	You really seemed to enjoy it.
1	#	Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?
1	#	Yeah...
1	#	So...?
1	#	Alright, but let me ask you this question.
1	#	Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" or, "Why would Jerry bring anything?" You emphasize "Jerry" or "bring."
1	#	You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)
1	#	Hey, so where's my sneakers?
1	#	What do you mean?
1	#	So all my sneakers are gone?
1	#	Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!
1	#	Where ya goin'?
1	#	Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?
1	#	No Jon Voight Day, huh?
1	#	Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.
1	#	I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.
1	#	No, I don't know if I'm invited.
1	#	Yeah, you're right.
1	#	Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.
1	#	You don't want to go with me?
1	#	The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?
1	#	What?
1	#	Well, what is he, a vampire?
1	#	Oh, please.
1	#	No, it's stupid.
1	#	So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.
1	#	So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?
1	#	Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?
1	#	Elaine, would you marry me?
1	#	Alright. Forget it.
1	#	Hey, Tim.
1	#	Did you say, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show" or, "Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"? (Elaine comes over.)
1	#	Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.
1	#	Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?
1	#	Yes it is.
1	#	Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!
1	#	Parsippany, New Jersey.
1	#	My car's in the shop.
1	#	That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.
1	#	From your mother.
1	#	So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?
1	#	That's a 180, George.
1	#	Hi Willie.
1	#	I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.
1	#	Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Yeah, that's why I said hi.
1	#	Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.
1	#	Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.
1	#	I thought we were going to the movies?
1	#	Because you didnt have a job?
1	#	A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.
1	#	It's a little ...
1	#	You got no waist in that thing.
1	#	How fast was she walking?
1	#	No. I think it's Demi. (the "i" sounds like an "e")
1	#	What?
1	#	Oh, you're crazy.
1	#	Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.
1	#	Well, that was the worst.
1	#	Yeah, I think I do.
1	#	Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.
1	#	Uma Therman? Really?
1	#	He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?
1	#	He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
1	#	It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.
1	#	So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.
1	#	Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?
1	#	So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.
1	#	Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.
1	#	Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.
1	#	All right, all right. Im sorry.
1	#	How long has she been there?
1	#	It's almost a week.
1	#	Oh, My god.
1	#	It's a movie stub from the 930 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.
1	#	Hello, Willie.
1	#	No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?
1	#	Yeah. Specifically 930 shows. Seen any good 930 shows at the Paragon, Willie?
1	#	I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.
1	#	You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes
1	#	Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)
1	#	Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.
1	#	Now.
1	#	Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)
1	#	Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer.
1	#	No, not on me.
1	#	Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.
1	#	All right, Ill be back.
1	#	(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?
1	#	Kramer?
1	#	What clothes?
1	#	No.
1	#	What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.
1	#	Where are your pants?
1	#	What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.
1	#	Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?
1	#	Where are your clothes?
1	#	You mean what you were wearing?
1	#	How'd you expect to get out of here?
1	#	[Elaine]
1	#	Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)
1	#	Bania.
1	#	(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room)
1	#	Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?
1	#	I got an idea.
1	#	I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania)
1	#	Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?
1	#	Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.
1	#	Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.
1	#	You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.
1	#	all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.
1	#	. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.
1	#	Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room)
1	#	Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)
1	#	(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.
1	#	(grabs the ticket back) Give me that.
1	#	Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)
1	#	The ticket is worthless.
1	#	Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?
1	#	It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.
1	#	You cant have that coat, it's not yours.
1	#	What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!
1	#	Yeah, it's very good. (reluctantly)
1	#	Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't)
1	#	(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.
1	#	Oh, and who might that be?
1	#	If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.
1	#	Ready to go Lois?
1	#	Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
1	#	Duncan Meyers!
1	#	Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.
1	#	Hi oh.
1	#	She couldn't make it.
1	#	I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.
1	#	Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.
1	#	I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .
1	#	Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.
1	#	He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.
1	#	By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.
1	#	And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.
1	#	I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.
1	#	He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?
1	#	He say anything?
1	#	Oh, nothing in particular.
1	#	I did not cheat.
1	#	Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.
1	#	Yes
1	#	Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.
1	#	I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that
1	#	Wow, a communist. That's something.
1	#	The Daily Worker has personal ads?
1	#	Yours or hers?
1	#	Wow, look at you. So you got the job.
1	#	Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.
1	#	Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.
1	#	That's not bad.
1	#	I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?
1	#	Well, I . . . [sees George]
1	#	I'm sorry, uh,
1	#	Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High.
1	#	This is Lois.
1	#	I'm I'm a comedian.
1	#	Yeah, yeah
1	#	Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?
1	#	You really used to have a think full head of hair.
1	#	yeah, yeah.
1	#	Well you've really built yourself up into something.
1	#	Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.
1	#	Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?
1	#	George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.
1	#	I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	George!
1	#	Did I get a head start?
1	#	You satisfied? So you see?
1	#	No, no, no, another race - out of the question.
1	#	All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
1	#	And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus
1	#	So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.
1	#	Hello, oh hi Duncan, 400 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!
1	#	Hi how are you?
1	#	What's the matter?
1	#	What? He can't do that.
1	#	Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.
1	#	I need a miracle.
1	#	Yes, Mr. Beviacqua
1	#	Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.
1	#	Come on. Lets go
1	#	What's it doin here?
1	#	Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.
1	#	He's fantastic.
1	#	You loaned her Pitt's racquet?
1	#	Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.
1	#	Bye bye
1	#	Hm, really?
1	#	Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.
1	#	Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.
1	#	I'm glad you enjoyed it.
1	#	It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.
1	#	And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, "That's funny." ... That's funny!
1	#	I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!
1	#	What noise?
1	#	What blah?
1	#	Oh, you think she was refunding?
1	#	In a manner of speaking.
1	#	Thanks.
1	#	A matron?
1	#	uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).
1	#	Kramer you're going to have to face her some time
1	#	Why didn't you just ask her for it?
1	#	Yeah
1	#	C'mon up.
1	#	So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?
1	#	He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
1	#	Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?
1	#	Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!
1	#	So what happened with Kramer's mother?
1	#	What's she like?
1	#	What is it?
1	#	We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?
1	#	Hi, is Sandy here?
1	#	I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
1	#	So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
1	#	It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse "ha's." You know those?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.
1	#	So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.
1	#	Can't be done, huh?
1	#	"The Switch."
1	#	I wonder.
1	#	They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
1	#	The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?
1	#	I couldn't do it without you.
1	#	Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!
1	#	Yeah, sure we will.
1	#	All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage  trois with her and her roommate.
1	#	And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.
1	#	At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.
1	#	The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.
1	#	Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.
1	#	It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
1	#	You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.
1	#	Uh?
1	#	Hey
1	#	Ah, that's a shame.
1	#	Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.
1	#	No actually, she took it pretty well.
1	#	She's into it.
1	#	The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.
1	#	Oh, it's a scene man.
1	#	What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.
1	#	I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.
1	#	Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.
1	#	Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.
1	#	Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?
1	#	What do you mean you got caught?
1	#	I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.
1	#	Hi Cosmo.
1	#	Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?
1	#	Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?
1	#	Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.
1	#	You sure you don't want the tickets?
1	#	I can't believe I'm having trouble getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
1	#	I can't, the Drake put me in the wedding party.
1	#	Maybe he didn't know?
1	#	Row F, in front of the Gs, hobnobbing with the Ds and Es.
1	#	I asked. Elaine laughed at me, Kramer's only interested in Canadian football.
1	#	Come on, take them. You could take Bonnie.
1	#	What do you think?
1	#	Yeah, sleeping arrangements. So, you haven't, uh...
1	#	Aah.
1	#	The Dentist?
1	#	Oh, no. I explained the whole thing to him, he was fine with it.
1	#	Yeah, I blamed it on you. Hi Tim.
1	#	Ah, just a couple of gals out on the town, shopping and gabbing.
1	#	Hey. How would you like to go to the Super Bowl?
1	#	Here. Two tickets. Have a good time.
1	#	No no no. No dinner.
1	#	Tim, you didn't have to get me a thank you gift. I know, it's a label maker. The Label Baby Junior. Yeah, I hear they're good. Well, label me thankful. Okay, well you enjoy those tickets. Buh-bye.
1	#	Come in.
1	#	What is it?
1	#	Kramer, why do you have to (noticing Newman) Hello, Newman.
1	#	Take what?
1	#	So why don't you leave it at Newman's?
1	#	So that's here?
1	#	I don't wanna be Switzerland.
1	#	Alright, soldier boys, let's fall out.
1	#	Yeah, yeah.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Ok.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Yes it is. I got it as a gift, it's a Label Baby Junior.
1	#	Tim Whatley?
1	#	One Tim Whatley!
1	#	The same, he sent it as a thank you for my Super Bowl tickets.
1	#	Or maybe he liked your gift so much, he decided to get me the same thing. Perhaps it's an homage.
1	#	Well how did he react when you gave it to him?
1	#	He repeated the name of the gift?
1	#	Oh, well, if you repeat the name of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
1	#	Oh, you know, like when someone opens something up and they go, "Oh. Tube socks." What are you gonna do about it?
1	#	Why'd you get him a gift anyway?
1	#	Yeah, well, if you're getting him anything for his birthday, I'm alarge.
1	#	Male roommate, huh?
1	#	Is this a problem?
1	#	Well, maybe he's --
1	#	So he's an eligible receiver.
1	#	What's stopping them?
1	#	What does he look like?
1	#	He looks like you and he's working from the inside?
1	#	Not you.
1	#	We'll take a check please.
1	#	I know, you would drape yourself in velvet.
1	#	Many times. You love velvet, you want to live in velvet, everything with the velvet.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	So what?
1	#	Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.
1	#	Are you through?
1	#	The wedding is off? What happened?
1	#	I can't call Tim Whatley and ask for the tickets back.
1	#	Are you even vaguely familiar with the concept of giving? There's no grace period.
1	#	Possibly.
1	#	You may have a point.
1	#	Alright, I'll call him.
1	#	Oh, it's Risk, it's a game of world domination being played by two guys who can barely run their own lives. (Picks up phone and dials) Hello Tim? Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld, remember those tickets I gave you? Well it turns out I can use them. Oh, you do? I understand. Okay. Bye. He already made plans, he can't change them.
1	#	Thanks.
1	#	What are you gonna do about the roommate?
1	#	Well, the pickle breath is a good start.
1	#	What do you want?
1	#	I'm not letting you cheat, Newman. You're not getting anywhere near that board.
1	#	You're not a little anything, Newman. So just pack it up and move it out of here.
1	#	I dunno, watch it on TV I guess. Why?
1	#	You're going to the Super Bowl?
1	#	What's his name?
1	#	That's my ticket!
1	#	(as Newman leaves) Newman!
1	#	Newman. He's going with Newman.
1	#	Newman's his mailman.
1	#	Who goes *anywhere* with Newman?!
1	#	He is merry, I'll give him that. (notices a cactus on the table) What's this plant for?
1	#	Oh, well the cactus will smooth things over.
1	#	What?
1	#	What about the label maker?
1	#	Wait a minute, that's my ticket! You didn't even want to go.
1	#	So, how did you get up there? Did you say you had to use the bathroom?
1	#	Then how'd you get up there?
1	#	That's why you're going to the Super Bowl.
1	#	You go out with a guy one time, you ask him to go upstairs like you're Mae West? Of course he's gonna try and get you alone for the weekend.
1	#	Obviously.
1	#	Yeah, well I don't trust this guy. I think he regifted, he degifted, and now he's using an upstairs invite as a springboard to a Super Bowl sex romp.
1	#	Hey. What are you doing?
1	#	My door?
1	#	(still outside) What was that?
1	#	(after entering) The bedroom!
1	#	I see you, Newman! I see you!
1	#	So she kicked him out of the apartment.
1	#	Wow, she rearranged her whole life for you.
1	#	That's not a good role for you.
1	#	You unwittingly made a major commitment. That's a lot of pressure.
1	#	You wanted to be ensconced in velvet, you're buried.
1	#	He was shouldering.
1	#	Where are you going?
1	#	Oh, well here. Take Whatley's label maker, I don't want to see it again.
1	#	So, too bad about that Super Bowl ticket, eh Newman?
1	#	(walking out) Thanks for having me over, guys.
1	#	Alright, I'll see you later.
1	#	Ah, Tim Whatley. Out scalping?
1	#	Are you serious, what about Elaine?
1	#	Oh. (notices a car being jacked up by a tow truck) Hey, isn't this Kramer's car? (yelling up) Hey, Cosmo!! They're towing your car!!
1	#	Yeah, see you there.
1	#	H... G... F. Seat four. One, two, three... f-- Hello Newman.
1	#	Oh, it's enchanting.
1	#	Can you move over at all?!
1	#	An inch! Can you move over an inch?!?
1	#	So you called the cop a pig?
1	#	Didn't you explain that to the cop?
1	#	(to George) Hey.
1	#	Oh yeah, I knew.
1	#	He told me a few months ago.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Oh yeah, he's fine, fine. He was in bad shape for a while though.
1	#	No, he was on his regular bed.
1	#	He swore me to secrecy.
1	#	It's not like you're my wife.
1	#	Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.
1	#	That's right, you let him have it.
1	#	Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?
1	#	His illness is your business.
1	#	If not now, when?
1	#	If I told you, you woulda given it away.
1	#	No, but he would've read your face.
1	#	Do you ever win at poker?
1	#	The Jujy Fruits?
1	#	I never heard her say hi.
1	#	It's like a game of tag.
1	#	Where you going?
1	#	You're going to the book store to see Jake Jarmel, aren't you?
1	#	Hey. How'd it go with Gary?
1	#	(suspicious) Really?
1	#	You look like something's on your mind.
1	#	So, that's your poker face.
1	#	No it isn't. I've seen your regular face. That is not it.
1	#	All right George, c'mon, what d'you got? (sits opposite George)
1	#	What you got, a pair of bullets?
1	#	Two pair? Three of a kind?
1	#	Oh my God, you got a flush! You're holding a flush!
1	#	A full house? You got a full house? Turn 'em over George, I wanna see 'em. Come on, I'm calling! (thumps hand on table) What d'you got!
1	#	So what was wrong with him?
1	#	So he's been lying to me for two months?!
1	#	What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.
1	#	I don't even think you could do it.
1	#	Yeah, I guess you could.
1	#	Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?
1	#	Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)
1	#	Why not?
1	#	So you're telling me, because you're getting free parking, I gotta pretend this guy had cancer when he didn't?
1	#	Well I don't like it. I don't like it one bit! And, I'm supposed to see him tomorrow.
1	#	Why didn't he tell me?
1	#	I don't think I can be that nice.
1	#	Gary?
1	#	Is that from my gift certificate?
1	#	(through gritted teeth) Yeah, well, I'm glad you could take advantage.
1	#	I don't think so.
1	#	Okay. (shuts mouth)
1	#	Hey. Look at you. Wha... what's this?
1	#	You look like a pirate.
1	#	(gesturing) This is Gary.
1	#	Can't see on your right side?
1	#	Hey, do you know what the Whip does?
1	#	The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.
1	#	Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.
1	#	Yeah!
1	#	Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.
1	#	She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?
1	#	Walked right over to her table.
1	#	You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.
1	#	What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?
1	#	So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!
1	#	(unimpressed) I, really can't say.
1	#	It's not good, okay. It's not good. You look (searches for word) stupid. (to salesman) I'm sorry.
1	#	Why don't you get a pair of white shoes, move down to Miami Beach and get the whole thing over with?
1	#	Oh, hey, I'm being helpful. I am the only one being helpful!
1	#	Hey! I'm trying to prevent my friend from becoming one of those guys people snicker at behind their back, because they look ridiculous! No offence to you personally!
1	#	All right! Take it easy! Take it easy.
1	#	I'm sorry.
1	#	What?
1	#	You know, Gary (slams shut the door) I had a little chat with George the other day...
1	#	(advancing on Gary) ...and he told me that that... (becomes indistinct)
1	#	Gimme that thing!
1	#	Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.
1	#	You stink. You know you stink. What is this?
1	#	Oh. Your ballet tickets.
1	#	No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.
1	#	A beard?
1	#	Yes.
1	#	Why are you doing this?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Well what about me?
1	#	It sounds like an excellent idea.
1	#	You can't go wrong with pouty.
1	#	Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?
1	#	Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.
1	#	And did they suspect anything?
1	#	And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.
1	#	You said that already.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
1	#	Yeah, but?
1	#	So?
1	#	Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
1	#	You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.
1	#	Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.
1	#	Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.
1	#	They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.
1	#	Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.
1	#	You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.
1	#	Are you that desperate?
1	#	So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.
1	#	What are you looking for?
1	#	Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.
1	#	What about a plastic bag?
1	#	What is the difference?
1	#	So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
1	#	What did you say to her?
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	As you see it?
1	#	Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?
1	#	You know, you're little hair hat there.
1	#	Don't you think she could tell?
1	#	Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.
1	#	Have you noticed people staring at your head?
1	#	Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.
1	#	Oh, I'll split a cab with you.
1	#	Hi Sarge.
1	#	What's that?
1	#	Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?
1	#	Really.
1	#	No.
1	#	I admit it. I don't watch it.
1	#	The poly?
1	#	Yes. Melrose Place.
1	#	Well I do.
1	#	Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
1	#	And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.
1	#	The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.
1	#	It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.
1	#	I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
1	#	Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?
1	#	Did you shake it up?
1	#	You gotta shake it up.
1	#	Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.
1	#	So tonight are you going to make the move?
1	#	Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
1	#	How so?
1	#	She's bald?
1	#	Women go bald?
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Good to have you back.
1	#	She's as good as anybody else.
1	#	Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.
1	#	So George, how do I beat this lie detector?
1	#	Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.
1	#	All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.
1	#	What?
1	#	Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
1	#	Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said "Too bad he's gay".
1	#	Jerry Seinfeld.
1	#	129 West 81st street.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.
1	#	He went back? What do you mean he went back?
1	#	I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.
1	#	You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
1	#	Well there's always a place for you, on our team.
1	#	Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
1	#	Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.
1	#	All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.
1	#	Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.
1	#	I would think.
1	#	(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
1	#	Yeah? Would you do it?
1	#	Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.
1	#	Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.
1	#	I have to go over to my grandmother's.
1	#	I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
1	#	No, we have time.
1	#	Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.
1	#	Like toothpaste?
1	#	There's a squeeze ketchup.
1	#	Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?
1	#	I really don't see the difference.
1	#	It's subtle.
1	#	(looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.
1	#	Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.
1	#	Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
1	#	Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.
1	#	Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.
1	#	No, I told you I admire your hearing.
1	#	No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.
1	#	Bye.
1	#	(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.
1	#	Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.
1	#	(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?
1	#	She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.
1	#	Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.
1	#	What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.
1	#	Speak of the devil.
1	#	What for?
1	#	Why?
1	#	(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.
1	#	(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.
1	#	Hello, uncle Leo!
1	#	Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
1	#	Hi Nana.
1	#	Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.
1	#	(also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.
1	#	Will you stop it.
1	#	Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
1	#	I'm just not getting any hot water.
1	#	Thanks, Julio.
1	#	Huh?
1	#	What's going on here?
1	#	(suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?
1	#	What for?
1	#	(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?
1	#	I told you, forget it.
1	#	You're robbing me.
1	#	(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
1	#	Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?
1	#	Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.
1	#	Yeah?
1	#	Come on up.
1	#	No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.
1	#	It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.
1	#	Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.
1	#	(muffled) Hi Wendy.
1	#	(muffled) Would you like something to drink?
1	#	(muffled) There you go.
1	#	Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.
1	#	So, how's everything going?
1	#	Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.
1	#	C'mon, that's not fair!
1	#	No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.
1	#	(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?
1	#	Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...
1	#	...You can't put that picture up.
1	#	Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.
1	#	(not really) Yeah.
1	#	Oh, sure, yeah.
1	#	Oh, no!
1	#	You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
1	#	What is so funny?
1	#	Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.
1	#	(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
1	#	(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
1	#	(not as eager) Hi Joan.
1	#	Pretty good.
1	#	Okay, great.
1	#	Oh, I'm delighted.
1	#	You too.
1	#	Hi, Louise.
1	#	Ah, well. Thank you very much!
1	#	(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!
1	#	Family?
1	#	You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.
1	#	Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.
1	#	I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.
1	#	You should have her work on it for you.
1	#	Hi Mary.
1	#	Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....
1	#	...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
1	#	Hi Louise...
1	#	...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.
1	#	(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.
1	#	Hello.
1	#	Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?
1	#	Okay, I will.
1	#	(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.
1	#	Hey, Kramer, look at this.
1	#	Look at my picture!
1	#	I've been defaced!
1	#	Hi Jack.
1	#	Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?
1	#	(defensive) No no, that's not true!
1	#	You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.
1	#	Buddy?
1	#	So you were with him that day at the track?
1	#	Leo?
1	#	Is that so?
1	#	Well, that's very interesting.
1	#	(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.
1	#	(with a triumphant point) You're busted!
1	#	Hey, Steve. How you doing?
1	#	Hey, Jeff. What's happening?
1	#	Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.
1	#	Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!
1	#	Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...
1	#	Hey. Could I use your shower?
1	#	(pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.
1	#	(impressed) Who's that?
1	#	Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.
1	#	(rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.
1	#	(indicates with his thumb) Yeah, I'm just going up to see Elaine Benes.
1	#	Oh, she's uh, she's house-sitting for Mr. Pitt.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Can I just go up?
1	#	How 'bout those Knicks?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	I am not going back down there. I can't face that guy again.
1	#	The doorman. I don't wanna play anymore of his mindgames. What time does he get off?
1	#	Well, it's almost six now. Can't we just wait til he goes home?
1	#	We'll still make the movie.
1	#	Uh, that doorman's still milling around outside. He's very peculiar.
1	#	(picks up phone) Hello? (listens) Oh, hi Mr. Pitt.
1	#	Alright, he just left. We can go.
1	#	(surprise) You? Wh...what're you doing here? You work at this building too?
1	#	So you work all day as a doorman at one building. Then you come home and stand outside your own building?
1	#	Look, I'm not going in your building. I really don't have to talk to you. Goodbye.
1	#	Yeah, and?
1	#	What d'you mean, breasts?
1	#	So what? A lot of older men have that.
1	#	But, your father's not bald.
1	#	Then I suppose the bosom gene comes from your grandmother.
1	#	Boy, that brain never stops working, does it?
1	#	What? Nothing.
1	#	What has this guy got a personal vendetta with me?! What'd I do to him? 'Cos I asked him about the Knicks?
1	#	No.
1	#	Alright. Can we go to a later show, so he's off his shift when I come by?
1	#	Yes, we do.
1	#	He's... trying to get something off his chest.
1	#	(jumps in surprise) Hoh! What're you doing here? You're supposed to be gone.
1	#	(trying to ease the tension) Look, I don't want any trouble. I don't have a doorman in my building. I guess I'm just not used to talking to them. I'd really just like to be friends.
1	#	I'd like to be.
1	#	What?
1	#	Wha...? Wai... wait a second. What do I do?
1	#	Oh.
1	#	(to the man in the elevator) Hey, hey. Wait a second. Hey! Hello!
1	#	Hey, hey, wait a second. You live here?
1	#	(after the guy) You think you're better than me?
1	#	Oh, right.
1	#	(dismissive) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1	#	He left me there. You see the mind games?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	He asked me to. We were getting along.
1	#	Don't you find it odd that as soon as he leaves, the couch gets stolen? Maybe he's setting me up!
1	#	Alright, well what if we say...
1	#	I came to pick you up.
1	#	I know. I was just...
1	#	Alright, well. Just, start again, then.
1	#	Right.
1	#	What? I said right.
1	#	But the doorman's gonna say that I was there.
1	#	But I don't know if this is gonna work.
1	#	Okay.
1	#	You're saying I'm responsible for the couch?
1	#	(livid) Diabolical. He thought of everything. He was setting me up from day one!
1	#	I'm sure he's having a good laugh over this with his doorman buddies.
1	#	Now we have to buy a new couch?!
1	#	The one with the Poppie stain?!
1	#	It's hardly been used.
1	#	Poppie!
1	#	What're you doing here?
1	#	Ohh. Hey, how you feeling?
1	#	Hmm.
1	#	No, Poppie! No!!
1	#	"Jimmy"
1	#	"I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to himself in the third person. "Jimmy's under the boards. Jimmy's in the open. Jimmy makes the shot."
1	#	"Why. You took a shower?"
1	#	"Aw right."
1	#	"No...Got dental appointment."
1	#	"Yeah!"
1	#	"Oh! How d'you like that?"
1	#	"I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."
1	#	"All right."
1	#	"The Velvet fog?"
1	#	"What the hell his a velvet fog."
1	#	"Well , where is it?."
1	#	"AMCA?"
1	#	"Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."
1	#	"They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."
1	#	"I don't think so."
1	#	(interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay much attention to men`s faces."
1	#	"No... I find them repugnant and unappealing."
1	#	(pointing Kramer) "To wit"
1	#	"No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could admit a man is attractive."
1	#	"Really!"
1	#	"Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine, you will appreciate this. I'm sitting in Tim Whatley's waiting room...He's got a Penthouse right out on the table."
1	#	"Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean , I'd be embarrassed to have that in my apartment."
1	#	(outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like a sterile environment."
1	#	"Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."
1	#	"What are you doing that for, you got a job"
1	#	" Yeah! What's that."
1	#	"Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars. Jimmt and George are gonna get rich."
1	#	"Kom Pau(sp?"
1	#	"Ahh! You too with these?"
1	#	"So what did Tim say?"
1	#	"Looks like he gave you some Novocaine"
1	#	"So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"
1	#	"Adults only?"
1	#	"What the hell's going on over there?"
1	#	"You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the dentist.
1	#	"Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the floor. How much Novocaine did that guy give you."
1	#	"Why are you taking this so personally?"
1	#	"What about the Velvet Fog ?"
1	#	"Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the cab?"
1	#	"Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk , he's wearing these shoes, he's drooling."
1	#	"Well...........you know....."
1	#	"Not necessarily because....."
1	#	"Oh! where's Jennifer today?"
1	#	"I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed and not only that; my shirt was out!!!"
1	#	"I think so."
1	#	"You know! Like a tennis shirt."
1	#	"Sometimes I tuck'em sometimes I don't"
1	#	"I think I was tucked.!"
1	#	"I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like there was no tomorrow."
1	#	"Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?"
1	#	"I don't think I'm hungry"
1	#	" But I'm damaged goods now."
1	#	"Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the health club.?"
1	#	"Jimmy?
1	#	"That's the guy?"
1	#	"Can't believe your going out with him..."
1	#	"I dunno. He's so strange.'
1	#	"Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third person. Jimmy can dunk. Jimmy's new in town. Jimmy we'll see you later."
1	#	"That's Jimmy. That's the way he talks."
1	#	"Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine.."
1	#	"Why?"
1	#	"I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"
1	#	"What's that?"
1	#	"No no you said George likes spicy chicken."
1	#	"You're turning in to Jimmy."
1	#	"Where's my Mr. Goodbar?"
1	#	(cuts in) A nude model.
1	#	You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me see her naked. Hundreds of people see her naked every week, except me. Needless to say it was quite vexing.
1	#	Yeah!
1	#	What?
1	#	(spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on these and put them on the plate?
1	#	Soo...
1	#	No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..
1	#	It's just...
1	#	Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.
1	#	Yeah, but with you it's intentional.
1	#	Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi digested food stuff. You know the next stop is the stomach and you can take it from there.
1	#	AH. Yes that's gonna make a big difference.
1	#	Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big deal about the pecan.
1	#	Thanks.
1	#	Ah! boy.
1	#	Yeah! So
1	#	Yeah! It's a doodle.
1	#	Oh!.It's an affectionate caricature.
1	#	It's just a drawing.
1	#	the usual
1	#	Good for you
1	#	Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just so you could stay in a hotel room.
1	#	Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.
1	#	Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.
1	#	Don't ask.
1	#	No ,it's George ( Elaine laughs heartily)
1	#	You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....
1	#	What's in?
1	#	Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for two weeks a year..
1	#	Nah, I don't wanna
1	#	I don't want it..
1	#	I DON'T WANT IT ....
1	#	I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.
1	#	..What is this?
1	#	Yeah! I think I got flea bites.
1	#	Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.
1	#	No.
1	#	How could I have fleas?
1	#	What did you do about them?
1	#	Nothing...
1	#	Mom, Dad.....I have fleas..
1	#	I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.
1	#	I don't understand this..
1	#	Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in town.
1	#	Okay..
1	#	I have fleas.
1	#	I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment for two days. I don't know what I'm gonna do with my parents. they'll never let me pay for a hotel and if they go to someplace on their own I'm sure it's gonna be some awful dump. Wait a second.. Have you checked in The Plaza yet?
1	#	Come on,c'mon
1	#	c'mon ,c'mon....
1	#	c'mon, c'mon....
1	#	Yes!!!
1	#	Yes!!!
1	#	I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be upset from the masticated pecan incident.
1	#	Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to my parents. They brought it with 'em.
1	#	You see the thing of it is, there's a lot of ugly people out there walking around, but they don't know they're ugly, because nobody actually tells them.
1	#	I dunno...
1	#	That'd be the fleas.
1	#	Hey!!!
1	#	Yeah! it's all taken care of.
1	#	Oh! Hey!
1	#	Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go in there it's being fumigated.
1	#	You see?
1	#	I told you to take it.
1	#	Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.
1	#	Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.
1	#	Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple of minutes.
1	#	How do you feel?
1	#	Well wh..wh.what are you doing?
1	#	Didn't you see the sign on the door?
1	#	Can you get me a soda?
1	#	I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.
1	#	Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?
1	#	Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!! I've got him.
1	#	Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.
1	#	There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..
1	#	Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman is wildly scratching behind his back. he suddenly stops when Jerry turns around)
1	#	You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate the skin and they start to...itch. Oh! maybe you can hold out five seconds or ten, maybe fifteen or twenty but after a while, no matter how much will power a person may have. It won't matter, because they're crawling , crawling on your skin. Up your legs , up your spine , up your back.....
1	#	Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.
1	#	( embarrassed laugh) ...Oh! Damn..
1	#	I forgot my toothbrush.
1	#	Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.
1	#	(long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the toothbrush)
1	#	Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!
1	#	She's seen you in this thing.
1	#	And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.
1	#	Ahh! She threw me out.
1	#	I wouldn't use her toothbrush.
1	#	Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.
1	#	I hear you're going out with David Putty.
1	#	Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.
1	#	Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.
1	#	The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.
1	#	All right.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Yeah, so.
1	#	What move?
1	#	Wait a second. *My* move?
1	#	David Putty used *my* move?
1	#	Are you sure?
1	#	I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
1	#	Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.
1	#	Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.
1	#	What?
1	#	No! He stole my move!
1	#	Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.
1	#	Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.
1	#	I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.
1	#	...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
1	#	Can I just get it opened first?
1	#	All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).
1	#	You feel better?
1	#	Nancy Klopper?
1	#	All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---
1	#	It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---
1	#	All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.
1	#	Is it padded?
1	#	Good. How tall is she?
1	#	You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.
1	#	George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.
1	#	Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.
1	#	I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.
1	#	What is it?
1	#	When did you do this?
1	#	Oh... Why Fusilli?
1	#	Well, thank you very much.
1	#	Assman?
1	#	Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?
1	#	It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.
1	#	Yeah. Proctologist.
1	#	I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
1	#	Hey, David.
1	#	Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.
1	#	What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.
1	#	The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.
1	#	Swirl.
1	#	Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.
1	#	You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.
1	#	Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.
1	#	Fine.
1	#	You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?
1	#	Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.
1	#	Yeah?
1	#	C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.
1	#	Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.
1	#	Except that it's not Putty.
1	#	Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.
1	#	Hey, Elaine.
1	#	Is it something I said?
1	#	Really?
1	#	What is it?
1	#	Huh.
1	#	Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?
1	#	You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.
1	#	Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)
1	#	That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.
1	#	Yeah. Kramer made it.
1	#	Hey, Assman!
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.
1	#	Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.
1	#	Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.
1	#	Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?
1	#	I don't know. Why?
1	#	What do you mean?
1	#	Really, stopping short. That's a good move.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Oh, my god!
1	#	If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.
1	#	He had to use cork-screw pasta.
1	#	Assman!
1	#	What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs up)
1	#	Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six hours.
1	#	I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.
1	#	So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.
1	#	You're marchin' in.
1	#	Hey. Elaine's quitting.
1	#	How 'bout the march out?
1	#	Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
1	#	Why?
1	#	What for?
1	#	Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
1	#	Yes, I know. I've flown before.
1	#	No.
1	#	I don't care.
1	#	Who?
1	#	I don't care, why are you telling me this?
1	#	Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
1	#	Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... up here... um... I..
1	#	No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the audience really freaked me out.
1	#	If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. I became obsessed with him.
1	#	Oh, it doesn't matter now.
1	#	Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!
1	#	(To Katie) What is the complication?
1	#	Yes?
1	#	What?
1	#	I didn't care.
1	#	He can't just throw me off the plane!
1	#	But I'm not a disturbance!
1	#	But someone is waiting for me!
1	#	I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!
1	#	Which one do you think I want?
1	#	Then we'll make it the eight.
1	#	Hotel?
1	#	No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.
1	#	I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?
1	#	George.
1	#	I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's Club...
1	#	Carl, I think.
1	#	Yeah, he was nice.
1	#	Defent.
1	#	You need an exterminator?
1	#	Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?
1	#	George, George!
1	#	Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?
1	#	Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to be late.
1	#	Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll never get another date with her. She'll freak out.
1	#	I am a little freaked out!
1	#	All right, but you have to go now.
1	#	(Wakes up) Where are we?
1	#	Is this even a road?
1	#	What? Why didn't you wake me up?
1	#	No, road is a major detail!
1	#	(Pointing ahead) Look out!
1	#	That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
1	#	Bridget!
1	#	Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our whole time together.
1	#	Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!
1	#	What are you telling him for?
1	#	He's the busboy, you think he cares about the soup?
1	#	Elaine, it's all this guy can do to keep from killing himself. You think he's back there, talking to the chef, going, "Hey, they like the soup! Keep it up!"?
1	#	Yep, Alec Berg. He's got a good 'John Houseman' name. Alec Beeerg. Mr. Beeerg.
1	#	John Houseman?
1	#	Hi, Alec.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah, hey did I see you on TV at the Ranger game? Were those your seats right behind the glass?
1	#	Oh, I'd love to, are you sure?
1	#	Gee thanks! Thanks a lot!
1	#	Alright, thanks again.
1	#	Really, thank you.
1	#	Well what about these nitwits that get on a plane with nothing to read? You know who these people are?
1	#	These are the people that want to talk to you. They got nothing else to do, why not disturb you?
1	#	They're the worst.
1	#	Well, what is with you?
1	#	Yeah, he's dating a crayon.
1	#	Toilet paper?
1	#	What are you talking about?
1	#	Toilet paper's changed.
1	#	It's softer.
1	#	More sheets per roll
1	#	Comes in a wide variety of colors.
1	#	What?
1	#	Well, that's a big move, Georgie boy. Are you confident in the 'I love you' return?
1	#	Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there.
1	#	Well, so it wasn't a total loss.
1	#	Hey, I forgot to tell you! I got tickets to the Rangers-Devils playoff game tonight!
1	#	What about you, George?
1	#	Well, what do I do with the extra ticket?
1	#	Sure, fine with me.
1	#	"I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat."
1	#	Big matzoh ball.
1	#	Those damn 'I love you' returns.
1	#	Oh, you don't know.
1	#	Unless you're married.
1	#	No, people hate that.
1	#	Ideally.
1	#	No question about it.
1	#	At the zoo?
1	#	Kramer, you threw a banana peel at a monkey?
1	#	It's a monkey, Kramer!
1	#	Well, I still think it's wrong.
1	#	I'm not taking anyone's side.
1	#	No.
1	#	What do I gotta call him for? I thanked him five times when he gave them to me, how many time I gotta thank him?
1	#	No, I don't believe in it. I'm taking a stand against all this over thanking.
1	#	Hey, if I knew I had to give him eight million 'thank you's, I wouldn't have taken the tickets in the first place.
1	#	Ah, you're out of your mind.
1	#	I gotta get a suit cleaned, I have a funeral on Friday.
1	#	Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?
1	#	No, car accident. He was trying to adjust his toupee while he was driving and he lost control of the car.
1	#	The one Puddy screamed at in the car?
1	#	Well, that's what you get for getting mixed up with a face painter.
1	#	Gotta support the team.
1	#	Hm.
1	#	Hm.
1	#	Hm.
1	#	(noticing Alec Berg walk in, whispers) Hey, Alec!
1	#	Did you see that? What kind of a 'hello' was that?
1	#	I mean, do you think it's possible that he's mad at me because he didn't get the day-after 'thank you'?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah, yeah, that's kinda what he gave me.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Well?
1	#	Well, I don't think that's gonna happen.
1	#	What?
1	#	Are you gonna say it again?
1	#	What? After what you just went through, I thought you said you'd never say it again.
1	#	He's gonna talk into her other ear.
1	#	Yeah, I saw him.
1	#	Well, not exactly.
1	#	I don't know if he's mad.
1	#	Well, I didn't really get a good 'hello', but see, I was at a funeral.
1	#	See, so I don't know if I got a funeral 'hello' or he was mad because he didn't get his day-after 'thank you'.
1	#	Look, what do you want me to do?
1	#	No. No, I can't!
1	#	Look, we got five hours before the game. I am betting it was a funeral 'hello'. He knows we're here, he knows the number, he knows we want to go. There's plenty of time for him to call and give us the tickets.
1	#	Hello? Oh, hi mom. No, listen, I was expecting somebody else. I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I gotta keep the line clear, I'll call you later. Yes, I know I have call waiting but I don't trust it in an emergency. Good bye.
1	#	No.
1	#	Alright! (picks up the phone and dials) Hello, Alec? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. You know, you got a great 'John Houseman' name. Alec Berg. Did you hand in your assignment, Mr. Berg?
1	#	Well, Alec, the reason I called is I just wanted to thank you for the tickets from the other night.
1	#	Oh, you already gave them away?
1	#	No, we don't care, we just want to go.
1	#	(To himself) Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.
1	#	She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you do in a situation like that?
1	#	I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.
1	#	Of course.
1	#	yeah,
1	#	The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.
1	#	She might be. She's the star of the show.
1	#	Yeah, maybe.
1	#	That's the understudy. I'm dating her.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back stage and having to think of something to say.
1	#	Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.
1	#	How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
1	#	Why don't you go to another nail shop?
1	#	What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell you what they're saying.
1	#	You know who speaks Korean?
1	#	George's father.
1	#	He used to go there a lot on business.
1	#	He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, that were manufactured in Korea.
1	#	George, does your father speak Korean?
1	#	Oh, hi Gennice.
1	#	This is George, this is Kramer.
1	#	Playing today?
1	#	They really stick to that understudy rule.
1	#	It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything is going to be okay.
1	#	Come on George, just loosen up.
1	#	Come on George.
1	#	(to George) Keep going.
1	#	Well we
1	#	(with no emotion) It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.
1	#	Come back another time.
1	#	I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody up.
1	#	Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.
1	#	Stop your crying will ya?
1	#	Hey, I had nothing to do with it.
1	#	We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her the whole thing was an accident.
1	#	What?
1	#	What happened?
1	#	Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.
1	#	Where?
1	#	(pushing her) How did you get that?
1	#	You met J. Peterman?
1	#	What is he like?
1	#	(walking away) Yeah, I'll see ya'.
1	#	Well, break a leg tonight.
1	#	Listen buddy,
1	#	What is it?
1	#	Oh, I'm so sorry.
1	#	So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes you lose control?
1	#	Good luck.
1	#	And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's pretty sick.
1	#	Yeah, what else?
1	#	Happy, Pappy? What does that mean?
1	#	Oh, you're "Pappy".
1	#	Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?
1	#	Hey, I got a real thing about "shushing"!
1	#	Ahh.
1	#	What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
1	#	OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. We're not men.
1	#	We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these women.
1	#	Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
1	#	We're pathetic you know that?
1	#	Why can't I be normal?
1	#	It would be nice to care about someone.
1	#	Hmm. I thought she became a lesbian.
1	#	Oh.
1	#	Hmm.
1	#	See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?
1	#	Well, this is it. I'm really gonna do something about my life, you know? You know, I think I'm gonna call Melanie again. So what if she shushed me. GEORGE, I am really gonna make some changes.
1	#	I'm serious about it.
1	#	I'm not kidding.
1	#	Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!
1	#	I had a very interesting lunch with GEORGE Costanza today.
1	#	We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized we're kids. We're not men.
1	#	Yes. We did.
1	#	There isn't?
1	#	Well...
1	#	Really?
1	#	I can?
1	#	What?
1	#	Boy.
1	#	I'm glad we had this talk.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	You're going to rub out the dog?
1	#	What, you're considering this?
1	#	How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
1	#	Hey!
1	#	What are you up to?
1	#	What's the rope for?
1	#	The dog. You're getting the dog.
1	#	Did what?
1	#	You're getting married?
1	#	Oh, my god!
1	#	I'm blown away.
1	#	Wow!
1	#	And she said "Yes"?
1	#	You're gonna have gorgeous kids.
1	#	Pinkish hue?
1	#	Well...actually, we kind of broke up.
1	#	Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. But she scooped them.
1	#	Yes. That's what was so vexing.
1	#	What?
1	#	You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married.
1	#	You thought I was gonna get married?
1	#	I mean, you love Susan, right?
1	#	You want to spend the rest of your life with her
1	#	So?
1	#	No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?
1	#	I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
1	#	Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! Celebrate! How about some champagne?
1	#	Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!
1	#	You know what? No champagne. Anyway. . . I'll see you later.
1	#	Ready?
1	#	Oh, how come?
1	#	Well, she could come.
1	#	Oh.
1	#	Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should be good.
1	#	Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing at the same Cineplex.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he was shooting back at them as he was falling?
1	#	Oh, man!
1	#	Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?
1	#	What was that?
1	#	Oh, Mattingly just singled .
1	#	I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
1	#	We come from the same place.
1	#	Very strange.
1	#	So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?
1	#	All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
1	#	Sorry!
1	#	All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total shock.
1	#	George Costanza...
1	#	Is getting married!
1	#	Newman.
1	#	Really? What happened?
1	#	Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
1	#	That's great.
1	#	That looks pretty good.
1	#	Hey, say, you know, we haven't even discussed George's engagement yet.
1	#	Come on! GEORGE is getting married!
1	#	Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
1	#	What's the matter?
1	#	Well, you don't seem too enthused about the whole thing.
1	#	Well, at least have some reaction to it.
1	#	Maybe you're a little jealous.
1	#	No! But maybe you wish it was you who was getting married, not him.
1	#	Oh, yeah. Right.
1	#	Lainy!
1	#	You don't wanna get married?
1	#	Oh, come on!
1	#	You're such...
1	#	Hey.
1	#	We're gonna change the system.
1	#	Hey!
1	#	Have I ever been less than forthright?
1	#	Yeah, I probably have. Yeah, of course I have. What am I talking about?
1	#	Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium to the floor ...door comes down. Hides your feet. Yes. I like it. I like it a lot.
1	#	I think it's fantastic. I think it's a fantastic idea.
1	#	Yes, I do.
1	#	Hmm.
1	#	See, now that I don't care for.
1	#	It should resolve of its own volition.
1	#	Momentum - same thing.
1	#	Yeah, I know.
1	#	You're turning.
1	#	If you need more time, you should have more time.
1	#	Sure you can. Why not?
1	#	I don't see why not.
1	#	Sure, go ahead.
1	#	Spring. Of course.
1	#	Beautiful.
1	#	No, she's not.
1	#	Well, she's a woman. They don't like to be disappointed.
1	#	Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
1	#	Oh, all the way.
1	#	Is that so?
1	#	Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?
1	#	You're kidding?
1	#	You would turn me in?
1	#	I can't believe your a friend of mine.
1	#	Well, I am sure I had a good reason.
1	#	But you know me!
1	#	So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
1	#	Another Caf Latte?
1	#	Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole Caf Latte?
1	#	I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.
1	#	Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One show only.
1	#	You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying to get a table and I missed it.
1	#	Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.
1	#	Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
1	#	Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
1	#	I live and breath my friend. . . . I live and breath.
1	#	tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.
1	#	Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up sex after.
1	#	You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.
1	#	In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.
1	#	. . . Poor bastard.
1	#	Good evening, Rabbi.
1	#	Well, Rabbi, well.
1	#	Yeah, that's right.
1	#	What do you mean?
1	#	No.
1	#	is that so?
1	#	Really?
1	#	I didn't know any of this.
1	#	Hum, well it all comes as news to me.
1	#	You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
1	#	Understand you had a little talk with him too.
1	#	Yes I know, I know.
1	#	Nothing, nothing.
1	#	Yes he did.
1	#	We had quite a little chat.
1	#	Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it was you who were getting married instead of him.
1	#	It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.
1	#	He did it.
1	#	That's what's so fascinating.
1	#	You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let you in with it.
1	#	Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
1	#	That's the rule.
1	#	Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me
1	#	Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.
1	#	No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?
1	#	Yeah, she's something else. Hey, so what happened? Did you hold your ground or...uh
1	#	What?
1	#	You cried?
1	#	Sorry about that movie-thing. I was joking around.
1	#	Suing? What for?
1	#	It's supposed to be hot.
1	#	Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer that?
1	#	I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit it's available, it's there, it's 2 aisles over.
1	#	Where you going?
1	#	Discount?
1	#	So ah, what did you do last night?
1	#	I know nothing, but what did you actually do?
1	#	Wow. That really is nothing.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	What are you all dressed up for?
1	#	Oh yeah, how's that looking?
1	#	Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.
1	#	Hi Bob.
1	#	(Apologetically) Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.
1	#	I hear it's ah beautiful there.
1	#	(Surprised) Huh?
1	#	This is a, Bob Cobb.
1	#	Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?
1	#	Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.
1	#	Because it's a stupid thing to be called.
1	#	Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association Orchestra.
1	#	Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.
1	#	New shirt?
1	#	No, not particularly.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for you right?
1	#	(Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.
1	#	No.
1	#	Are you sensing anything right now?
1	#	Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.
1	#	Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.
1	#	I know you will.
1	#	His lawyer.
1	#	What?
1	#	Why are they settling?
1	#	All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?
1	#	What do you mean?
1	#	So?
1	#	I thought they wanted to settle.
1	#	Then you're in a lot of trouble.
1	#	Did you have a good time?
1	#	(Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.
1	#	So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro.
1	#	You didn't mind?
1	#	O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".
1	#	Why not you call him Maestro.
1	#	Well, I'm great.
1	#	What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?
1	#	You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of the clear blue sky he says there's nothing to rent. As if he doesn't want anyone else there.
1	#	I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
1	#	In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
1	#	Hey you know we were just talking about you.
1	#	Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there were no houses available in Tuscany?
1	#	No. I'm not really looking.
1	#	So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
1	#	I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?
1	#	How'd you get yours?
1	#	Maybe I'll check out France.
1	#	Hey George, do you believe this guy?
1	#	Bob Cobb.
1	#	You know, the Maestro.
1	#	Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where in Tuscany to rent.
1	#	No.
1	#	I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to keep me out of Tuscany.
1	#	I have no idea.
1	#	Oh, no way it's that big.
1	#	Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
1	#	Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.
1	#	Yeah and?
1	#	So are you gonna get him a chair?
1	#	Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check things out. With a back or without.
1	#	Swivel?
1	#	I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents used to have a kitchen chair that would have been perfect.
1	#	Yes.
1	#	How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? Wait a minute. Poppy's from Tuscany. I'm gonna go call him.
1	#	Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little Italy.
1	#	Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?
1	#	That's it?
1	#	You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
1	#	You're racing!
1	#	Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.
1	#	Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.
1	#	Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?
1	#	Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?
1	#	I didn't actually want to rent it.
1	#	So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was just wondering if there were houses there to rent.
1	#	You didn't have to push me.
1	#	75,000 lira.
1	#	Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.
1	#	You know I don't even know why I brought you.
1	#	Not bad!
1	#	I don't know. Blind date?
1	#	Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
1	#	I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.
1	#	You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.
1	#	Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.
1	#	Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
1	#	A healthy person.
1	#	Oh, sorry
1	#	I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.
1	#	You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
1	#	Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?
1	#	Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. It's a twenty to one shot.
1	#	Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like a leper colony down there.
1	#	UNDATEABLE!
1	#	Alcohol.
1	#	Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
1	#	Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.
1	#	Hi,
1	#	Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.
1	#	Well, no, I'm not one of those.
1	#	Grandma Memma?
1	#	No, I think I would have remembered Memma.
1	#	What do you recommend besides the steak?
1	#	Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
1	#	You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
1	#	(mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
1	#	Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?
1	#	Did she mention anything about our lunch?
1	#	What do you mean, "kind of."?
1	#	What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't respect salad eaters.
1	#	But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?
1	#	What is she making?
1	#	Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.
1	#	Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.
1	#	Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.
1	#	I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket)
1	#	This is some FINE mutton.
1	#	Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)
1	#	What?
1	#	I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
1	#	Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?
1	#	Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going on?
1	#	Why were dogs chasing you?
1	#	I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed and it's where I sleep.
1	#	Head to toe?
1	#	I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.
1	#	I'll make them later. Uh.
1	#	It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
1	#	Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.
1	#	Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.
1	#	I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?
1	#	You spent the night at James's? Did we?
1	#	Reversed positions?
1	#	So what your genitals are still lined up.
1	#	Yeah. Come on up.
1	#	Hey. What's all this?
1	#	I thought we were going out.
1	#	Franco?
1	#	I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
1	#	That is so Franco.
1	#	I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
1	#	What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
1	#	We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.
1	#	Hey, what happened to my jacket?
1	#	Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.
1	#	(to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman catalog. (to George) Get this one "I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours later, lost in the fiord, a welcoming smile. Thank god she spotted the epaulettes on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest".
1	#	I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more work.
1	#	How do you pull that off?
1	#	Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!
1	#	So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan walking shoe yet?
1	#	What marathon runner?
1	#	Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept at the Olympics 4 years ago and missed the marathon?!
1	#	He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?
1	#	How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?
1	#	I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd think you'd have, like, 6 alarm clocks, payin'-off little kids in the village to come banging on your door...
1	#	Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.
1	#	You gotta wake him up!
1	#	I've seen her in your building.
1	#	I didn't know she was married.
1	#	Whom I gonna tell?
1	#	He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
1	#	My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an extra 5 and it never came back on. (Kramer enters with a bucket and starts filling it with water on the sink) Imagine your whole life riding on an alarm clock.
1	#	What do you do?
1	#	Always works?
1	#	Hot tub?
1	#	Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded you?
1	#	I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
1	#	Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.
1	#	Sorry about the Olympics.
1	#	Ah...catalog writer's block?
1	#	(pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?
1	#	AM/PM.
1	#	Ah...the volume.
1	#	Ah, separate knob.
1	#	Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder than the radio.
1	#	Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have anything to say about it.
1	#	Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?
1	#	It's a simple question...
1	#	That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because of that alarm clock?
1	#	Elaine...
1	#	You're 40 minutes late. What happened?
1	#	No.
1	#	Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, and you weren't.
1	#	Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete in a very difficult race, he's put his faith in you, and frankly, I'm a little concerned!
1	#	Yes I am.
1	#	Yeah, I know that!
1	#	I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer come in) I'm talking about waking him up!
1	#	Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?
1	#	What happened?
1	#	Yeah. I hope so ?!
1	#	Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell she's doin'! I gotta take over this whole operation!
1	#	I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got goin' there.
1	#	Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm concerned. Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps the biggest race of your entire career. And the person with whom you have chosen to stay... is uh...
1	#	I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, you'll be near the starting line, and most importantly... you'll have a wake-up call, Jean-Paul! A wake-up call!
1	#	These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock all night long, just waitin' to make that call! (George comes in)
1	#	Hey, how was the meeting?
1	#	Sons of bitches?
1	#	How many sweaters you got on?
1	#	Your core temperature?
1	#	Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!
1	#	Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
1	#	Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count on me! (hangs up)
1	#	I got the call...!
1	#	(stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
1	#	Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.
1	#	All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the clock. Notch good... 650... volume check. (music playing, he starts swinging) What kinda music you wanna wake up to? Top 40, classical...
1	#	How about adult contemporary?
1	#	All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm away, gets phone) now... the failsafe. The wake-up guy... (dials)
1	#	Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 650 AM tomorrow morning.
1	#	That's room 419. 650 AM. Four...one...niner...
1	#	I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I don't wanna take any chances.
1	#	Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you here...
1	#	...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)
1	#	humm...
1	#	I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
1	#	(gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!
1	#	What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
1	#	(pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)
1	#	Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a controlled environment.
1	#	Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd be polishing that medal right now. (covers Jean-Paul with a blanket)
1	#	That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. (goes knocking on Kramer's)
1	#	(shouting) Man that thing is noisy!
1	#	Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 630 and gimme a call.
1	#	He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
1	#	Frankly, I'm a little concerned.
1	#	402? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!
1	#	Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in the car!
1	#	Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity went out!
1	#	What happened to your mental alarm?!
1	#	Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the way! Make way! Make way! Make way, it's a contender! (an event guard stops them)
1	#	All right, go, it's a race! Come on!
1	#	I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never even went near your building!
1	#	Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
1	#	Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!
1	#	Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
1	#	You're a shmoopy!
1	#	You're a shmoopy!
1	#	Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place?
1	#	All right, then. I'll see you later.
1	#	Bye shmoopy.
1	#	No. We gotta go to the soup place.
1	#	He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.
1	#	You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.
1	#	There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.
1	#	He yells and you don't get your soup.
1	#	Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
1	#	All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.
1	#	The main thing is to keep the line moving.
1	#	Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.
1	#	Elaine.
1	#	Ar-moire.
1	#	He gave you the nice face discount.
1	#	What about the soup?
1	#	[in French accent] Pardon.
1	#	It's like this all the time.
1	#	Oh, no. It is. Just be still.
1	#	Hard to believe.
1	#	Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line.
1	#	Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again.
1	#	Medium crab bisque.
1	#	Just forget it. Let it go.
1	#	Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?
1	#	I gave you a taste. What do you want?
1	#	I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!
1	#	I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
1	#	Hi shmoopy.
1	#	You're a shmoopy!
1	#	Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?
1	#	Why?
1	#	Just like that?
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
1	#	Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.
1	#	What are you gonna get?
1	#	You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!
1	#	Uh-oh.
1	#	Do I know you?
1	#	It was a bisque.
1	#	Really?
1	#	Have you tastes the soup?
1	#	See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Oh, thanks.
1	#	So, did these thieves want any money?
1	#	They just wanted the armoire?
1	#	Yeah?
1	#	Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?
1	#	I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something.
1	#	Hello.
1	#	Absolutely not.
1	#	Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
1	#	Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?
1	#	I don't know, but you look like you're happy.
1	#	You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy.
1	#	Is that so?
1	#	Disgusting?
1	#	Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her.
1	#	What?
1	#	You're still with the pact?
1	#	All I did was shake your hand.
1	#	It was stupid of me.
1	#	No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
1	#	What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that.
1	#	So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?
1	#	Aw!
1	#	Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.
1	#	Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
1	#	Well, we're changing the rules.
1	#	What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy?
1	#	Yum yum little tuna fishy?
1	#	I'm heading over to Elaine's.
1	#	Those two?
1	#	Are you sure?
1	#	Well, let's confront 'em.
1	#	There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on.
1	#	Let's go.
1	#	I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..."
1	#	Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going?
1	#	Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup.
1	#	Elaine, let the man make his soup!
1	#	Well. Well.
1	#	Hey, Susan, George.
1	#	Oh, really?
1	#	Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
1	#	Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection.
1	#	Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.
1	#	Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.
1	#	What is it?
1	#	Wha - wha - what's the matter?
1	#	Well, where are you going?
1	#	So why didn't you tell her the code?
1	#	George, you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.
1	#	So you're taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?
1	#	Actually, that's the definition of selfish.
1	#	No one's ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'
1	#	Of course. C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up inside. Sing it, sister.
1	#	What if my life depended on it?
1	#	My foot fell asleep.
1	#	I crossed my legs, I forgot to alternate.
1	#	Hey Fred.
1	#	My foot fell asleep.
1	#	Fred, do you know Elaine?
1	#	Seeya.
1	#	So?
1	#	And he didn't remember you?
1	#	Where are you going, you just got here?
1	#	Hey that sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should really be fun.
1	#	Uh huh, okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do some TV spots for Leapin' Larry's Appliance Store. That was Leapin' Larry himself, I'm gonna meet with him tomorrow.
1	#	What is that?
1	#	Yeah, those civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.
1	#	You're lucky they let you drive a car.
1	#	(waving his arm in dismissal) Eh.
1	#	Really? I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.
1	#	Well, what's to be said? He didn't remember you.
1	#	I know.
1	#	Yeah, I know.
1	#	Yeah, you wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
1	#	Why would I wanna do that?
1	#	Yeah, sounds like fun.
1	#	Howbout this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our prices, we'll give you the store.
1	#	No I don't.
1	#	(to himself) My foot's asleep again!
1	#	You know what? I'll be with you in a minute.
1	#	Larry, wait, you don't understand!
1	#	I didn't do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.
1	#	Ya know, the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry, you'd think he had a sense of humor about it.
1	#	Yup.
1	#	Wow, the whole building burned down.
1	#	Of course.
1	#	The amazing thing is you never have any place to go.
1	#	We're gonna meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.
1	#	Of course not, if I did would you have gone?
1	#	There you go.
1	#	Trust me, you're off.
1	#	...Alright, you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. The only way I can bribe the guards to get you out is for you to give me your ATM code.
1	#	They're closed.
1	#	Bomb threat.
1	#	Midnight Express, my friend.
1	#	Yes, hi, Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.
1	#	Well, is Elaine here?
1	#	Without Elaine? What for?
1	#	We gotta get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.
1	#	George, what's the matter with you?
1	#	Actually, you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that I'd do a set tonight, so, terribly sorry.
1	#	I can't believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.
1	#	Fred?
1	#	You see what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't remember anything about you.
1	#	That's God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.
1	#	Well, when I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the hell out of there.
1	#	Nah, he didn't make it.
1	#	I did not bail out on you.
1	#	Why didn't you come up with your own?
1	#	Ah, c'mon. Maybe you're just in a slump?
1	#	Oh, come on, just tell me your code already. What is it?
1	#	Fire station?
1	#	Nah, I gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.
1	#	Yeah, we straightened it out, all is forgiven.
1	#	No I didn't.
1	#	Anyway, thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.
1	#	Oh sure.
1	#	Uh, again? (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.
1	#	Beats me.
1	#	Kramer?
1	#	Ah, that's a shame.
1	#	Oh my god. Look at this.
1	#	It's the new J. Peterman catalog. Look.
1	#	Well, what do you mean?
1	#	Well I think that's pretty obvious.
1	#	Hey Elaine.
1	#	Who, who, who do you think would win in a fight between me and ah, gorgeous George here. (pointing up and down at George)
1	#	Mona a Baldo .
1	#	Why?
1	#	Really? What would you do?
1	#	Hmm.
1	#	Im sorry.
1	#	Ah, how about 830?
1	#	You want to get something to eat first?
1	#	Hey, why don't cha ask Susan?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Why?
1	#	How come?
1	#	Kramer this is Ramon, from the new health club I joined.
1	#	No what?
1	#	Really?
1	#	Ahh.
1	#	OK, see you later.
1	#	Yeah. (Kramer sits in the seat next to Jerry) Uh, uh, oh, oh, Over there. (points to the next seat over)
1	#	Little buffer zone.
1	#	Thank you. If we were in my apartment and we were watching a movie on the couch, would we sit right next to each other?
1	#	All right.
1	#	What are you doing?
1	#	Oh hey, there's Ramon. Pre, pretend we're talking.
1	#	Pretend it's interesting.
1	#	That's shocking, but sounds ...
1	#	Oh, hey Ramon.
1	#	Oh, no thanks. (turns back to Kramer)
1	#	No.
1	#	And then the worst part is, after the movie, he leached on to us ... We wound up having coffee with him for like two hours. Then he walks us home, all the way back to the front of the building. Finally I said, look Ramon, I gotta go to bed now.
1	#	No why?
1	#	Oh yeah, I know.
1	#	Well it was my idea.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	She was looking for someone to go to the show with.
1	#	World's collide. (points at George)
1	#	Because this world is your sanctuary and if that world comes into contact with --
1	#	I didnt know. Kramer told me about the worlds.
1	#	Yeah, I guess I slipped up.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	What is it?
1	#	555-3455.
1	#	(picks up the phone on the coffee table) 555-3455. Well wait a second, don't you see that's 555-FILK.
1	#	Filks nothing, but 555-FILM is Movie Phone.
1	#	Yes, so people are just dialing it by mistake and getting you.
1	#	You're Filk.
1	#	Oh, well, I didnt actually go with Ramon. I just bumped into him there. (putting on coat)
1	#	All right, I gotta go.
1	#	What else did you two do?
1	#	Ah, so, ah, flower shows and, shopping for pretty bows, and then back to her place, strip down to bra and panties for a tickle fight?
1	#	Yes, I do. (very serious)
1	#	Hey you know George isn't to happy, ahh, about your new friendship.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	You're looking up movies for people now?
1	#	(shaking his head no) No Kramer I don't want to talk to him.
1	#	Oh that's George. (presses the intercom button) Yeah?
1	#	What?
1	#	(to Ramon) Oh. Okay. (to Elaine) Wh, what is he doing here?
1	#	He's the pool guy.
1	#	Do me a favor. Just stick around while he's here.
1	#	Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.
1	#	Hey. So, ah, Ramon this is my friend Elaine.
1	#	So, ah, what are you doing around here Ramon?
1	#	Ah, actually, I ka, kinda had some things to do.
1	#	Ah, just, you know, I don't know. Stuff, I gotta do. (grabs coat and throws it over his shoulder)
1	#	All right.
1	#	All right Ramon, Im going to get going.
1	#	I think we should separate here actually.
1	#	Look Ramon, you're, you're a nice guy. But I, I actually only have three friends. I really can't handle any more.
1	#	That has nothing to do with it.
1	#	I, I love that George.
1	#	So you want to catch a movie later?
1	#	I don't have a paper though.
1	#	Ramon, what are you doing here? You could get in trouble.
1	#	What?
1	#	Look Ramon, about the other day. Im sorry if I offended you. I get a little crabby on the subway.
1	#	What happened to all the towels?
1	#	It's been a terrible situation down there the past couple of days. He's really been making things uncomfortable for me. There's always a big pile of dirty towels in front of my locker ...
1	#	And then when I come out of the pool, my towel's always gone.
1	#	Tell me about it.
1	#	You're meeting Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
1	#	Im meeting George for lunch at the coffee shop.
1	#	Ah, you know. Im supposed to meet, eh, someone -- Ill, Ill wait for them outside. (walks towards the door)
1	#	This is gonna to be ugly. (quietly)
1	#	(coughing) I said, boy am I ugly.
1	#	We'll pull up another chair.
1	#	I see you there Ramon.
1	#	Hey, lll just keep swimming. Hey, hey. Im not done. I know what you're up to Ramon. Because Im a member here, this is my place to swim.
1	#	Hey, you better cut it out Ramon. Just stop it.
1	#	(NO!)
1	#	I think he's gonna need, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Well? Go ahead.
1	#	You knocked him out.
1	#	Come on Newman. Do it.
1	#	He might die.
1	#	So eventually these people came and, somebody, gave him mouth-to-mouth.
1	#	Yeah, it was a gamble.
1	#	Ah. (makes face)
1	#	Oh I can't. They revoked my membership. Newman too. You know, we can't go anywhere near there.
1	#	I can't figure out what's going on here. I can't follow the plot. Why did they kill that guy? I thought he was with them?
1	#	What is he doing in the Chunnel?
1	#	Whad you think Susan?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yep. Since college. (Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.) Hey, Lena Small's on this list.
1	#	Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and now here's her number.
1	#	That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.
1	#	Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to me.
1	#	I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying a speedboat.
1	#	See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. (Elaine laughs.) All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home free.
1	#	So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you wouldn't have gone out with him?
1	#	Yeah. So you really like this guy.
1	#	How's the...sexual chemistry?
1	#	Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...
1	#	Hey. What's the matter?
1	#	What about?
1	#	I got a date with that girl, Lena.
1	#	I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... (Jerry stops, and mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica on the phone at work.)
1	#	What?
1	#	I dunno. (Elaine enters.) Hey.
1	#	So what are you gonna do?
1	#	What are you all out of breath from?
1	#	And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, you're in horrible shape.
1	#	I got a 31 waist, mister!
1	#	Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.
1	#	It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
1	#	They serve soup at 6 a.m.?
1	#	Do the bums ever complain? "Soup again?"
1	#	How could you not?
1	#	Is it a lot of cream soups?
1	#	Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
1	#	Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.
1	#	Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?
1	#	Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
1	#	You're never gonna make it!
1	#	How'd you find out?
1	#	George!
1	#	Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -
1	#	You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
1	#	You went all night?
1	#	Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, three hours! You're never gonna make it!
1	#	So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.
1	#	A friend of a friend of Susan's.
1	#	Why'd you tell her?!
1	#	Well you know what this means, don't you?
1	#	You're cut off, you're out of the loop!
1	#	You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
1	#	If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed someone?
1	#	I don't know, George.
1	#	You know what? That was the amazing thing.
1	#	No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about this girl.
1	#	She's too good.
1	#	I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!
1	#	I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with someone you admire.
1	#	No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even has sex.
1	#	I thought you said it was imminent.
1	#	Sponge-worthy?
1	#	But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're free to go at anytime.
1	#	Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you about something...you know, because you're such a good person -
1	#	Oh, o.k. (Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens of boxes of Today sponges.)
1	#	What? Nothing.
1	#	Oh...
1	#	Tell you something...I do.
1	#	Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?
1	#	I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, you know. That's it. (Lena is puzzled.)
1	#	It completely turned her off.
1	#	I don't wanna be a 32.
1	#	She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
1	#	It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
1	#	Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my god...Kramer?
1	#	Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. (Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks at Kramer.)
1	#	Who?
1	#	Ruthie Cohen?
1	#	Sure.
1	#	Maybe that's why she's happy.
1	#	What is this?
1	#	That stinky old movie-house?
1	#	Geoffrey who?
1	#	I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.
1	#	Oh, then I'm not worried.
1	#	Lloyd.
1	#	(peering) That's an interesting package.
1	#	(chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?
1	#	Nah, don't bother.
1	#	I don't want it.
1	#	Alright.
1	#	I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum. It's a little lo-mein-y. (he spits it into the waste bin)
1	#	It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.
1	#	You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently for months.
1	#	And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.
1	#	Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?
1	#	I thought your parents were outta town?
1	#	Oh, can Lloyd really do that?
1	#	We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the special seats?
1	#	Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.
1	#	I don't know what I was thinking.
1	#	(noncommittal) Errh.
1	#	(taking them) Well, what's this for?
1	#	So what?
1	#	Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these on.
1	#	Ah, Lloyd.
1	#	(unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum.
1	#	(still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)
1	#	Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.
1	#	s not necessary.
1	#	I know that, Kramer.
1	#	Yes I do, Kramer.
1	#	I didn't see anything.
1	#	So you say she was on a horse?
1	#	Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. See if any high-flying cashier's been throwing twenty dollar bills around with big lips.
1	#	Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.
1	#	I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about the peepshow you gave him at the Alex.
1	#	Maybe it's in the lost and found.
1	#	You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.
1	#	Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?
1	#	Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!
1	#	Why?
1	#	Aw, these are really strong glasses.
1	#	(lacking enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah.
1	#	Absolutely. Let's just stick around.
1	#	Lloyd?
1	#	Lloyd?
1	#	Alright.
1	#	(handing it over) Here.
1	#	(indistinct) Got all this?
1	#	(incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?!
1	#	It's a lotta gum!
1	#	Maybe he'll write a song about you.
1	#	So I take it he's spongeworthy?
1	#	Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very, you know, uninhibited and free.
1	#	Oh, no?
1	#	Come on. Come on.
1	#	Elaine, you're among friends.
1	#	Oh.
1	#	Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?
1	#	Sure. Why not? You're there.
1	#	But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship. Maybe he's, you know, still....kind of...he...not gonna happen.
1	#	What stuff?
1	#	All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this. What did you buy here? You will never be able to finish all this stuff.
1	#	A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?
1	#	A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?
1	#	Look...look at this can of tuna!
1	#	This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about him upstairs with Elaine.
1	#	Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're pretty hot and heavy.
1	#	Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. He's in your friend John Germaine's band there.
1	#	Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	What?
1	#	Oh
1	#	Well, Clyde might not tell him.
1	#	I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
1	#	He stole back the rye?
1	#	Why?
1	#	So, do the Ross's know?
1	#	Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
1	#	Bad situation.
1	#	What do you mean replace it?
1	#	Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?
1	#	All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about it. Get the Ross's out of the apartment. That can't be so hard. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Wait a second! You know, Kramer's been driving that hansom cab.
1	#	Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.
1	#	Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about the clip clop, clip clop. They're nuts for it.
1	#	What about Susan?
1	#	Beautiful!
1	#	What the hell are you doing there?
1	#	No. No thanks.
1	#	Just put it under your shirt.
1	#	I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, I'll come by five after seven right after they leave.
1	#	So, you think Clyde told him?
1	#	Well, maybe it's a good thing.
1	#	No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound very pleasant.
1	#	No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, you're seeing him tonight so talk to him about it.
1	#	Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?
1	#	There's none left?
1	#	Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - I have to have that rye. It's a - it's a long story, but a person's whole future may depend on it.
1	#	Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it in yourself to give it up.
1	#	All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I will give you double what you paid for it.
1	#	All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now, be reasonable you cannot turn down $50 for a $6 rye.
1	#	Give me that rye!
1	#	I want that rye, lady!
1	#	Shut up, you old bag!
1	#	How much did you give him?
1	#	Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?
1	#	Really?
1	#	Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't get any oxygen.
1	#	(grunting as he throws bread into the air)
1	#	Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before. Your hook is too small. This is for, like, a muffin. All right. Take it away.
1	#	How did you lock your keys in the car?
1	#	So why don't you get a locksmith?
1	#	How long has your car been sitting in the Yankee parking lot?
1	#	Y- you're not playin' golf?
1	#	Really, you're getting that good?
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Yeah, we'll see ya.
1	#	That's a hell of an organization they're running up there. I can't understand why they haven't won a pennant in 15 years.
1	#	Locking your keys in your car is the best career move you ever made.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Yeah, what happened?
1	#	Sue Ellen Mishke?
1	#	Sounds familiar.
1	#	Oh, yeah, you mentioned her.
1	#	That is just shameless, I don't know, There's no--
1	#	It's wrong, it's rude, and it's incorrect.
1	#	We're only kidding!
1	#	What are you going to get her?
1	#	There's nothing subtle about that.
1	#	Have I ever bought you a jock strap as a gift?
1	#	What the hell are you doing here, aren't you supposed to be at work?!?
1	#	So, you're just taking off from work?
1	#	Do you think this is such a good idea, with you being on the verge of this big promotion?
1	#	Yello.
1	#	What's goin' on?
1	#	Yeah, so?
1	#	You know last time you had me throwin' a rye bread up three floors to you, now you want me to go up to the Bronx, take flyers off your car, where does it end?!?
1	#	Alright, alright, I'll do it!!
1	#	Hey, what are ya up to?
1	#	You wanna go with me up to (clap) the Bronx and see if there's any flyers on George's car.
1	#	I guess I coulda said just about anything there, couldn't I? (throws coat over his right shoulder)
1	#	Oh, man, look at this mess! You know what's gonna happen if they see this?
1	#	What are we gonna do?
1	#	Well, we gotta get it washed (pulls off a few flyers)....Ah, the keys are locked inside!
1	#	What are ya gonna do?
1	#	Yeah, this quite a life I lead here, huh?
1	#	Oh my God, Kramer, is that woman just wearing a bra?
1	#	Kramer!!! (Jerry points to the lamp post they are about to crash into)
1	#	I guess I have to bring his car back up to the stadium, if it can make it.
1	#	He was starin' at some woman!
1	#	There was this beautiful woman walking down the street wearing *just* a bra. I can't get that image out of my mind.
1	#	What?
1	#	Yeah!
1	#	Sue Ellen Mishke?
1	#	No, I don't.
1	#	Is there, something I can help you with?
1	#	Well, you can wait for him in here if you like.
1	#	No, no, not at all.
1	#	I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
1	#	I don't know
1	#	so the woman was walking around in a bra
1	#	I mean it's no big deal. You're still drivin'. You should have been watching the road.
1	#	I don't think my attitude has changed.
1	#	(quietly, yet in a high and whiney tone) Well, I don't know if I....
1	#	Kramer I don't think I can--
1	#	Well, I'm just not sure how I feel about it, Kramer.
1	#	Nothing's happened.
1	#	Oh, no, no, no, wait a second, wait a second th-th-that--
1	#	Kramer, it is not what you think.
1	#	And what about yooou?!? Tryin' to bilk an innocent bystander out of a family fortune, built on sweat and toil, manufacturing quality O'Henry candy bars, for honest, hard-working Americans!
1	#	You're just out for money!!
1	#	Where have you been?!?
1	#	I just got the most bizarre message from you father, Steinbrenner is at you house, they think you're dead!
1	#	Yeah, and we had an accident with your car, it's a, its a little crumpled.
1	#	Yeah, yeah, I didn't know what to do so I put it back at the stadium. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, they saw the car, they saw the blood, they couldn't find ya, that's why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead!
1	#	Well you gotta call your parents.
1	#	Aren't you gonna tell your parents you're still alive?
1	#	I don't know. Maybe.
1	#	....Alright, alright, I saw her!
1	#	And she was beautiful in that bra! I'm crazy about her! I love her whole free swinging, free wheeling attitude!
1	#	Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.
1	#	(admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.
1	#	(tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?
1	#	Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
1	#	You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.
1	#	You're really going to town with that turkey there.
1	#	It's on the door.
1	#	Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? That's like half a pound of turkey!
1	#	(sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your favourites on hand.
1	#	What arrangement?
1	#	(sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there and I will.
1	#	Hey. What's with your neck?
1	#	Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.
1	#	Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.
1	#	Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
1	#	Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned it...
1	#	Awright.
1	#	What's even more amazing is his formal training is in pediatrics.
1	#	I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to anyone who fixes your neck.
1	#	Oh yeah.
1	#	Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.
1	#	Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of school, seven beatings a day. Roughly seven stitches a beating, and eventually seven years to life. Yeah, you're doing that child quite a service.
1	#	Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug Costanza, that's original. (he turns and sees another item) Or uh, Ketchup? Pretty name for a girl.
1	#	I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? Pimento. Gherkin. Sauce. Maxwell House.
1	#	Oh, I forgot to call Christie.
1	#	Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop neck. She looked like some kinda superhero.
1	#	(smug) I'm not engaged.
1	#	Got what?
1	#	Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.
1	#	Sort of a mooching inventory.
1	#	Alright.
1	#	Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.
1	#	Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the best in the city.
1	#	The exact same outfit.
1	#	Three.
1	#	Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at the end of the cycle?
1	#	Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?
1	#	Indeed.
1	#	Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.
1	#	Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?
1	#	You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't destroy someone else's.
1	#	How about 'Mickey'?
1	#	(holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the fridge?
1	#	What?
1	#	You cannot buy half a can of soda.
1	#	Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation with you here, but you know the sound a can makes when you open it?
1	#	That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes for this, okay...
1	#	...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit. Not a third of an apple, not a half of a banana...
1	#	...You bite it, you bought it.
1	#	Thank you.
1	#	Hey
1	#	Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
1	#	Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have a knack for moving pieces of a person's spine around.
1	#	You saw her? What was she wearing?
1	#	Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
1	#	Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
1	#	Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but unfortunately, my friendship to each of you precludes my getting involved. What you need is an impartial mediator.
1	#	Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.
1	#	No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.
1	#	Oh, I'm sure you do.
1	#	Oh.
1	#	Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.
1	#	(looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.
1	#	Yes, change. By all means, change.
1	#	What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
1	#	No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.
1	#	You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on The couch. Then in the morning, you'll get dressed, we'll walk out together. Both dressed, different clothes. Well, I'll be in the same clothes. You'll of course be in different clothes, because it's your apartment. But we'll go downstairs, me in my same clothes, you in your different clothes.
1	#	You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
1	#	(pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you lay it out on the bed.
1	#	Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again? (listens) Oh really? Well you can't break up with me over the phone. C'mon, you gotta do this in person. It doesn't even have to be one on one, you can bring a group of friends. I just wanna see you. Wait, don't hang up on me. (hurriedly) Why d'you wear the same dress all the time? Hello.
1	#	Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little Smorgasbord here, but it's the end of the week, so I added up your tab.
1	#	I know. Pretty steep.
1	#	Few do.
1	#	Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...
1	#	...the food court is closed.
1	#	Oh, I'm back, baby.
1	#	Great. One of the best jobs I ever had.
1	#	I killed.
1	#	(taking off his jacket) Slaughtered. Wiped the floor with 'em and (hanging up jacket) not only that, the money was unbelievable.
1	#	Yeah. Highest paying job I ever had.
1	#	(reluctant) Nah, nah. I'd rather...
1	#	Nah. It's not good for friends to talk about money, it can affect the friendship.
1	#	And I'm always impressed.
1	#	Awright, fine. You wanna see it?
1	#	Okay.
1	#	Here, check that out.
1	#	I told you.
1	#	(taking back the check) Oh yeah.
1	#	What?
1	#	I never shoulda told you.
1	#	No, I can't feel anything.
1	#	Actually, I was thinking of donating a large portion of it to charity.
1	#	(deadpan) No.
1	#	No, to tell you the truth, I was thinking of buying my father a new car.
1	#	Maybe a Cadillac.
1	#	Yeah. (thinking) That would really blow his mind. He's always wanted one, his whole life, he's never been able to afford it. (decisive) I'm gonna do it.
1	#	Oh, isn't that what it's all about?
1	#	I want this baby fully loaded. (listens) Well, how soon can you get it there? (listens) Oh, that's terrific. (listens) Okay, thanks, bye.
1	#	Hey, guess what. I just bought my father a Cadillac
1	#	Yeah, I'm a very good boy. I'm flying down there and surprising him.
1	#	(joyless) Yeah, yes.
1	#	The actress?
1	#	Oh yeah.
1	#	Yeah?
1	#	Marisa Tomei?
1	#	How does she know Marisa Tomei?
1	#	You didn't ask how she knows Marisa Tomei?
1	#	Alright.
1	#	Go ahead. Seems like a reasonable question, is all I'm saying. I would've asked her.
1	#	What d'you mean, could've?
1	#	Ohh!
1	#	Really?
1	#	You know, she won an academy award?
1	#	Now there's a match. You and Katherine Hepburn.
1	#	Katherine Hepburn? Oh yeah.
1	#	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1	#	You like full lips.
1	#	Mmm-mmm. Too bad you're engaged.
1	#	(about the pie) This is no good.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	No.
1	#	Sure.
1	#	(about the cable guy) Nice people.
1	#	Well, what about Susan?
1	#	Would you tell Susan about it?
1	#	Well, if you can't tell Susan about it, then there's something wrong.
1	#	Hey, cable guy's looking for you.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Well, said he was waiting about two hours. Seemed a little put out.
1	#	You don't seem too bothered by it.
1	#	Boy, I've never seen you like this.
1	#	And, best of all, it's a Cadillac.
1	#	Ahh, I uh, I don't like to talk about it.
1	#	Ah, it's just money.
1	#	Oh, I don't know, play it by ear. Why?
1	#	Are you okay?
1	#	What was that?
1	#	I notice you threw 'stocky' in there.
1	#	Uhm, hold, hold on a second. (pauses counting) I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
1	#	Oh, right.
1	#	No, don't be silly, I've arranged a car.
1	#	Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
1	#	Surprise!
1	#	I'm a good son.
1	#	Just like that.
1	#	You wanna know? Come on outside.
1	#	C'mon, c'mon.
1	#	Well, what d'you think?
1	#	I bought it for you. It's yours.
1	#	I bought you a Cadillac. (hands over the keys) Here you go.
1	#	What?
1	#	How d'you know?
1	#	Why can't I buy my father a car?
1	#	(under his breath) Well, this worked out just as I had hoped.
1	#	That's what I was thinking.
1	#	Hiya, Jack.
1	#	That's right. I bought it.
1	#	He doesn't wanna take a ride.
1	#	Aahh!
1	#	Didn't you tell 'em I got the bill of sale? That proves I paid for it.
1	#	You know, you could put a fence around these condos, and call it an insane asylum. Nobody would know the difference!
1	#	Oh, hi Evelyn.
1	#	Who's she?
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Elaine? Wh..what's going on?
1	#	(a little confused) You wanna hang out here, at phase two of the Pines of Mar Gables?
1	#	Gee, I dunno what to tell you.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Uh, I don't think so.
1	#	I'll be back on Monday.
1	#	Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Alright, I'll see you.
1	#	(putting the phone back to his ear) Yeah.
1	#	Bye.
1	#	Gimme that rye!)
1	#	Shut up, you old bag!
1	#	Nice to meet you.
1	#	Yeah, there's some sickos out there.
1	#	You ever go to Camp Tiyoga?
1	#	(opening the door) Well, it was nice meeting you.
1	#	Ah, I think I'll go.
1	#	(confused) Dinner? W..What time is it?
1	#	(bewildered) Four-thirty? Who eats dinner at four-thirty?
1	#	I don't understand why we have to eat now.
1	#	Can't we eat at a decent hour? I'll treat, okay?
1	#	(emphatic) I'm not force-feeding myself a steak at four-thirty to save a coupla bucks, I'll tell you that!
1	#	Jack.
1	#	Hi Doris.
1	#	Awright, let's eat already.
1	#	Shut up, you old bag!
1	#	The bags are in the car, I guess we better go.
1	#	Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?
1	#	Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.
1	#	Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?
1	#	No.
1	#	No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.
1	#	Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.
1	#	Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.
1	#	No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.
1	#	Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.
1	#	(answering phone) Hello?
1	#	You gotta be there at 430.
1	#	Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air it at 1130.
1	#	30 years.
1	#	All right, I'll see you later.
1	#	Yeah, it is.
1	#	No economic reason for them to be here.
1	#	No social reason for them to be here.
1	#	I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?
1	#	You know Dad just called me.
1	#	Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.
1	#	All right, bye. (to Elaine) You see this? Any thought pops into their head they're calling me because it's a local call now.
1	#	I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!
1	#	The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.
1	#	(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?
1	#	I don't know how you do it.
1	#	A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't know. But it's none of my business.
1	#	Well...
1	#	Hey, it happens.
1	#	He has no idea who you are.
1	#	All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, "It's been real," move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.
1	#	Well, keep looking.
1	#	Yeah!
1	#	Me either.
1	#	You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm gonna have to shower in the dressing room.
1	#	Where are you going?
1	#	There's more food down the hall.
1	#	Oh, hi.
1	#	Actually, I'm drunk.
1	#	I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.
1	#	Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; they're crazy. Yep. My uncle Leo, (quick take of Uncle Leo in bet with Lydia, watching Jerry on TV. Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism. You know what I mean, the spaghetti's not al dente? Cook's an anti-Semite. Loses a bet on a horse. Secretariat? Anti-Semitic. Doesn't get a good seat at the temple. Rabbi? Anti-Semite.
1	#	Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend because of the bit I did. She thought it was funny, so he accused *her* of being an anti-Semite. They had a huge fight and now he's moving back into his apartment. You know what this means, my parents are gonna go back to Florida... What? What number is this? Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
1	#	Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, isn't that great?
1	#	Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?
1	#	No good?
1	#	Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?
1	#	(offering a plate) Chicken?
1	#	Poppy seeds!
1	#	Hello Newman.
1	#	Not from the footage I've seen.
1	#	What's going on?
1	#	Are you kidding?
1	#	Where are they moving to?
1	#	Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!
1	#	We could visit together!
1	#	That's incredible!
1	#	Why?
1	#	To spite my parents?
1	#	Your parents are crazy!
1	#	My parents are moving back too!
1	#	You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result of this. Food tastes better. The air seems fresher. You'll have more energy and self confidence than you ever dreamed of.
1	#	Hello.
1	#	Oh, hi dad.
1	#	Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're gonna move in here?
1	#	But it's a big complex.
1	#	All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)
1	#	They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
1	#	Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone just went from twelve hundred miles down to two feet! You gotta do something.
1	#	You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent Jerry! I gotta go see my Uncle Leo. I think he may have made a big mistake.
1	#	C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody.
1	#	Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're disgusting. You're bald, you're paunchy, all kinds of sounds are emanating from your body twenty-four hours a day. If there's a woman that can take your presence for more than ten consecutive seconds, you should hang on to her like grim death. Which is not far off, by the way.
1	#	Can you blame her?
1	#	What do you recommend?
1	#	Well, it's been a great visit.
1	#	Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided not to move. They couldn't bear being away from George.
1	#	You have no idea.
1	#	Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly, a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)
1	#	(Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!
1	#	Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?
1	#	(Modest) Oh, thanks.
1	#	(Blunt) I believe you.
1	#	(Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight to the airport.
1	#	Oh?
1	#	Uh-huh.
1	#	Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.
1	#	Oh, okay..
1	#	Ohh.. look at this..
1	#	I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this
1	#	I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
1	#	No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and this was going to be my bit on the show.
1	#	I'm out.
1	#	(Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.
1	#	Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's roommate, Sally.
1	#	(Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are you doing?
1	#	(Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
1	#	Like what?
1	#	(Confused) Where's the punchline?
1	#	A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
1	#	Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just ship it?!
1	#	Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.
1	#	Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you just came from the dentist!
1	#	Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the Charles Grodin show?
1	#	Uh.. one of the three tenors.
1	#	Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..
1	#	(Nodding) Yeah, the other guy.
1	#	Why?
1	#	Why not?
1	#	Hey, you look awful.
1	#	Problem in the bedroom?
1	#	Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?
1	#	I thought you didn't want the doormat.
1	#	Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New York?
1	#	Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!
1	#	It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.
1	#	(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!
1	#	(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!
1	#	Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.
1	#	Why don't you just get rid of it?
1	#	Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.
1	#	I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)
1	#	Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?
1	#	Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?
1	#	(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?
1	#	How come? I told you - It's fantastic.
1	#	I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?
1	#	(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.
1	#	Come in.
1	#	Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
1	#	How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
1	#	(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!
1	#	(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!
1	#	I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!
1	#	(Peeved) I don't have any material!
1	#	(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.
1	#	Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.
1	#	(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.
1	#	Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.
1	#	Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.
1	#	Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.
1	#	(Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?
1	#	Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.
1	#	(Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.
1	#	Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. Whispers) The other guy.
1	#	(Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something for you. The Ori-dent!
1	#	Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of packaging.
1	#	Well, I want to sit down.
1	#	It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!" gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)
1	#	(Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?
1	#	(Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!
1	#	(Slow whispering) This is a nightmare.
1	#	My pants!
1	#	What?
1	#	Dead man walking.
1	#	Well, one outta twenty thousand. That's not bad.
1	#	She did?
1	#	So? Wheels?
1	#	Beautiful.
1	#	So, set it up. You know what, we could have dinner at the Friars Club.
1	#	Yeah, I'm thinking of joining. Pat Cooper said he would put me up for membership.
1	#	Catnap?
1	#	(deadpan) That must be some book.
1	#	Just imagine how much more you'll accomplish.
1	#	I didn't know you had a hopper.
1	#	Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper made a reservation for me.
1	#	(downcast) Oh, I'm sorry.
1	#	(jocular) You just bought your own dinner.
1	#	(passing Hallie) 'Scuse me.
1	#	Hey, not bad. (pointing to crest) I kinda like this little thing here.
1	#	(to George) That might be the stupidest thing you've ever said.
1	#	(to George) I mean, come on. (a thought occurs) No, the stupidest thing you ever said was when you said Steve Kroft from Sixty Minutes is the same guy from *Seals and Croft*.
1	#	Oh, come on.
1	#	Alright.
1	#	(looking at Kramer) This is nice.
1	#	Morning?
1	#	(looks at watch) Ten-thirty.
1	#	(realising) Ohh, I don't believe this. I forgot to give it back. It belongs to the Friars Club.
1	#	Breakfast?
1	#	So this Da Vinci sleep is working out?
1	#	What d'you call it?
1	#	(deadpan) I think you need more sleep.
1	#	So, how'd your date work out with the mysterious Connie?
1	#	Oh, now you're being ridiculous.
1	#	(indicates the bowl of cereal) No milk?
1	#	(startled) Kramer!
1	#	(confused) Wha..? What time is it?
1	#	(aghast) Four in the morning?!
1	#	Well, what's wrong with you?
1	#	No. Would you just get out?
1	#	No!
1	#	Ready for lunch?
1	#	You think he's faking?
1	#	That was him?
1	#	Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
1	#	(standing) Alright, I'll see you later.
1	#	Hey, Bob.
1	#	Bob.
1	#	Hey, Bobby, over here.
1	#	Bob. Oh, Bob.
1	#	(louder) Bob!
1	#	(urgent whisper) Elaine.
1	#	I was just in the bathroom.
1	#	No, no, no. I was just in the bathroom with that Bob guy.
1	#	No, I kinda tried to test his hearing.
1	#	Well, I kinda snuck up behind him at the urinal and tried to see if he could hear me.
1	#	Well, he flinched, sort of.
1	#	Well, he kinda moved his head, you know. It mighta been on the zip up, I dunno.
1	#	Actually, no.
1	#	Right.
1	#	Come in.
1	#	That was something.
1	#	(positive) Fantastic. Fantastic woman.
1	#	I'm nuts about her.
1	#	She could be an 'it'.
1	#	She's got 'it' written all over her.
1	#	Well, I dunno. I didn't really talk to her.
1	#	Whatever.
1	#	That doesn't sound right.
1	#	Flying Sandos. Beautiful.
1	#	Walk me down to the Friars.
1	#	It's not here.
1	#	Th..the jacket, it's not here. It's gotta be here somewhere.
1	#	(to Kramer) Thanks for that four a.m. wakeup call last night. (frustrated) Where the hell is that jacket?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Oh, well, that's at the cleaners.
1	#	The cleaners? How did it get there?
1	#	(irritated) Great.
1	#	Somehow? You've had an hour and twenty minutes sleep in three days!
1	#	Alright. I just hope I can get it to the Friars Club before the show.
1	#	(to Kramer) Hey.
1	#	(louder) Hey!!
1	#	Sorry, sorry I'm late.
1	#	Yeah, it wasn't ready on time. I have to return it after the show.
1	#	Yeah. Well, let's hope this evening turns out a little better.
1	#	(smiling) I don't think so.
1	#	My jacket?
1	#	(giving in) Alright.
1	#	Hi. I..I was in the audience earlier. You threw my jacket down. I just wanted to pick it up.
1	#	(explaining) I had a jacket with a crest on it. You came into the audience, you threw it away. Agrabah.
1	#	Well, it was either you or one of your brothers.
1	#	It doesn't even belong to me. It belongs to the Friars Club.
1	#	(cynical) I'm sure it won't.
1	#	(downcast) No, I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
1	#	Yeah, we'll do it another time.
1	#	(looking after the guys) That nut is always up to something.
1	#	(into phone) Tell 'em I'll come down and talk to 'em. Okay, bye. (to George) Well, that was the Friars Club. D'you think they're gonna let a jacket-stealer join? I don't think so! They're gonna charge me eight hundred dollars for the jacket, and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper!
1	#	(worked up) Wh..what kinda show is that Sandos Brothers? They take your jacket, then they just throw it? I never heard of that!
1	#	(unenthusiastic) Uhh, I don't think so.
1	#	(impassive) Ah, I'm a little turned off.
1	#	Ahh, I'm, I'm kinda soured.
1	#	Yeah, I'm soured.
1	#	I'm sorry. I'm soured.
1	#	Well, you know, frankly, I don't think she was too concerned about my jacket.
1	#	(indifferent) Yeah, we'll see.
1	#	I'll try and de-sour.
1	#	(sharp) I'll try! I'll try and de-sour and sweeten.
1	#	I still don't know what that means.
1	#	(astonished) Oh god! What happened to you?!
1	#	Who?
1	#	What'd she do?
1	#	(bewildered) Why would she try and kill you?
1	#	Hey, there's uncle Milty.
1	#	(pointing) And there's David Steinberg.
1	#	The manager.
1	#	(to George) Hey, there's Pat. (calls) Hey, Pat.
1	#	I forgot to take it off.
1	#	I'm sorry.
1	#	Well, one of the gypsies took it.
1	#	Alright.
1	#	God, you're right.
1	#	Well, I'm a prospective member.
1	#	But that guy has my jacket.
1	#	Come on.
1	#	I dunno how that guy gave us the slip at the Friars Club.
1	#	Ouf.
1	#	Hey. It's you! (pointing) Th..that's my Friars Club jacket!
1	#	(adamant) No, no, no. That's my jacket, give it back.
1	#	C'mon I need it.
1	#	(determined) I wanna join. I need it to become a member.
1	#	Can you believe it?!
1	#	(examining) Hey George, you know what? I think this crest is different. It's got a moose on it.
1	#	Yeah. (subdued) I don't think this is the jacket.
1	#	Ohh, you got the jacket back.
1	#	(taking the jacket) Thank you.
1	#	Oh. (smiling) Oh, that's nice of 'em.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeahh.
1	#	Maybe she'll sweeten.
1	#	I'm looking for a crested blazer
1	#	I've worn one once and I really think it did something for me.
1	#	(softly) Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers.
1	#	You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll come back later with someone and see what they think.
1	#	Really I'll be back.
1	#	So I didn't like the crest all that much., but the guy spent fifteen minutes with me so to get out of the store I told I wanted to see what someone else thought.... And then he makes a face like he doesn't believe me.
1	#	Yeah..... He caught me So here's what I want you to do. Come back with me to the store and we'll pretend to look at the coat.
1	#	Because he thinks I was lying and I want to show him I wasn't.
1	#	But if you go back with me , then I'm not.
1	#	(to George) Problems with the house guest?
1	#	Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes a career choice.
1	#	(proud of himself) Remember me? I said I 'd come back with someone and I did. Surprised?.
1	#	Yeah.... well Elaine.
1	#	(impatiently cutting in) Hey Elaine What about the crest.? What d'you think of the crest here.
1	#	You what??
1	#	(giving up) Check.
1	#	You weren't supposed to say that.
1	#	That's not the point. You put me in a position where I had no choice.
1	#	And what about that guy asking you out right in front of me?
1	#	...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature of our relationship. You're there approving new clothes.....That's a girlfriend job! How dare he!!
1	#	No I gave it back to you
1	#	Oh Come on!!
1	#	I didn,t tell you to park in that lot .. Now someone's gonna have to drive you every time you need your car.? Take the bus!
1	#	Forget it.
1	#	He wont take ya..
1	#	Hey! Greg
1	#	Ah! right...nice. Lunch with Elaine?
1	#	You know 'm just curious, How did you know she wasn't my girlfriend?
1	#	Because you know we used to go out.
1	#	Oh Yeah we went way out and wild.
1	#	Hi Elaine.
1	#	How do you know she's not my wife?
1	#	Well, what about the ponytail?
1	#	C'mon Ponytail ...Get real.
1	#	Of course he did ..The guy's working ya.
1	#	Have you slept with him yet?
1	#	It's been known to happen....... telling you right now Elaine, this guy 's gonna dangle that dress in front of you like a dirt farmer dangles a carrot in front of a mule.
1	#	(interrupts)like a shark fisherman with a bucket of (?) Ch....
1	#	(continues)Like a shrimp farmer....
1	#	You know that clothing salesman had a lot of nerve hitting on Elaine right in front of me. He stands to make a big commission too on that jacket with the crest that nobody seems to like. You know what I'm gonna do.? I'm gonna take that jacket back.. I'm putting this guy ....RIGHT OUT OF COMMISSION....
1	#	Turn in?
1	#	It's only nine o clock.
1	#	I can't go to sleep at nine o clock!
1	#	Hey look ,you know, you're the one who's locked out. I'm letting you stay here. You're wearing my bathrobe. You should adapt to me.
1	#	Oh why don't you go sleep over at Newman's.
1	#	Well that's all I got.
1	#	Huh?
1	#	Kramer , there's no way you're sleeping with me.
1	#	Why?
1	#	Do I really have to explain why?
1	#	Yeah Why?
1	#	So ,Who is he?
1	#	Don't you see?...........It's all a big scam.
1	#	Excuse me I'd like to return this jacket.
1	#	........For spite...
1	#	That's right. I don't care for the salesman that sold it to me.
1	#	What do you mean?
1	#	That's ridiculous, I want to return it. What's the difference what the reason is.
1	#	Well I want to return this jacket and she asked me why and I said for spite and now she won't take it back.
1	#	. Well So fine then ..then I don't want it and then that's why I'm returning it
1	#	But I changed my mind..
1	#	OH! Hey!!
1	#	Hey You're staying with my friend George.
1	#	Well he doesn't even want himself there.
1	#	All right. (sits down)
1	#	They make wigs out of human hairs?
1	#	Bye!
1	#	...Guess so.
1	#	Hello..
1	#	(Interrupts) Excuse me...Excuse me... Are you asking him out ?
1	#	Right in front of me!. How do you know we're not together. Two guys, sittin' laughin' drinking Champagne Coolies.
1	#	Well we're sitting here together. Why wouldn't you think that.
1	#	Well it's very emasculating..
1	#	What bet?
1	#	Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars!?! Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader. I don't think so.
1	#	So the bet was that the loser has to buy dinner?
1	#	Huh.
1	#	No. nothing.
1	#	What's with you?
1	#	Wow.That's hot.
1	#	So know every time you get dressed. You are going to go down to the basement and use the dryer.
1	#	I got a date with Nikki.
1	#	She's also quite bold.
1	#	Hey, Elaine.
1	#	This is Nikki.
1	#	Oh of course. Todd Gack. You did you bet was in Star Wars? Sammy Davis Jr.
1	#	Why don't you see what you can do?
1	#	We'll see.
1	#	Yeah. Why?
1	#	Hey,that might be a nice idea for George's wedding.
1	#	Sure. If there cheap Why not.
1	#	Told you.
1	#	All right. Enjoy"Blame it on the Rain"
1	#	There really building a Utopian society up there huh.And you tribute all this to the calzone.
1	#	With you two guys at the helm. The last piece of the puzzle is in place.
1	#	So you don't make it a habit of giving to the blind.
1	#	So George. Remember when I told you Nikki gets whatever she wants. We are at the movies last night. It's sold out. Nikki goes and talks to the manager. Right in.
1	#	She's like a beautiful Godzilla.
1	#	What the hell is all this?
1	#	Why can't you do this on your table?
1	#	Hey. So how was"Blame it on the Rain?"
1	#	Oh!! Let me ask you a question. Was the movie part of the bet?
1	#	You know Elaine, It is not my way to intrude on the personal lives of close fiends....
1	#	Absolutely. But I feel I must inform you that what happened last night was more than a simple bet.
1	#	Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner
1	#	Because if he doesn't ask you out he doesn't get rejected. He has found a dating loop hole.
1	#	So what happened after the movie?
1	#	To the door?
1	#	That's a date.
1	#	But I never walk you home.
1	#	No, no.
1	#	So how did you leave it with him?
1	#	That's another loop hole. That's two dates without asking you out.
1	#	Crazy like a man.
1	#	I was got to be 55.
1	#	A lot faster than that!
1	#	Okay dokey
1	#	Absolutely. Nikki!
1	#	Would you mind bringing the officer the registration?
1	#	You must have gotten me when I slowed down to take that curve because for a while there I was doing well over 100.
1	#	All right Nik. That's it.
1	#	You got your shirt in my oven!?!
1	#	For both of us.
1	#	What's wrong with your oven?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Come on up.
1	#	I got some Cubans for George's wedding. They were more than I wanted to pay for but what the hell!
1	#	Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!
1	#	I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.
1	#	so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?
1	#	Why don't you get someone else from the office to go get Pisano's for you?
1	#	No. I never had a job.
1	#	Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.
1	#	What kind of pie are you cooking?
1	#	I did.
1	#	Well what could I do? Unless you pay him a visit.
1	#	Stupid cigars. You know if I didn't send Nikki over to talk to him they wouldn't be together.
1	#	It's like trying to smoke a chicken bone.
1	#	I think it's Dutch. I got to get going.
1	#	I... uh....promised Nikki that I'd walk her dog for her.
1	#	I know, I know. But some how she explained it to me and I couldn't say no.
1	#	What's that?
1	#	Oh.
1	#	Actually it's being taken care of right now.
1	#	He pulled an LBJ on you.
1	#	Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.
1	#	Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He planned the Hanoi bombing after a bad Thai meal.
1	#	Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.
1	#	You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him you're having trouble getting started, and you want his advice.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Can I have my keys...
1	#	(catching keys) ...back, please?
1	#	Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?
1	#	No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.
1	#	(re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit bottle scam again, are you?
1	#	(leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?
1	#	Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know those two idiots did something to it.
1	#	Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.
1	#	Hi Sue Ellen.
1	#	I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.
1	#	Think she wants those clubs.
1	#	Well, that's your ceiling.
1	#	I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.
1	#	Do you hear this clunking?
1	#	Okay.
1	#	Bye.
1	#	What's going on here?
1	#	Oh God!
1	#	(angry) Oh, you idiots!
1	#	Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?
1	#	And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said I was this close to sucking a muffin down the carburetor. What were you thinking?
1	#	Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.
1	#	Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He makes me feel guilty about every little thing that's wrong with it. I gotta get it washed before I bring it down to him, or I'm afraid he'll yell at me.
1	#	No, thank you.
1	#	Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I thought it might be time for a check up...
1	#	There's really nothing wrong on the inside.
1	#	No, I hadn't noticed.
1	#	Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and tear.
1	#	The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.
1	#	Try to.
1	#	The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?
1	#	You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be going downtown?
1	#	Okay, so how does it go?
1	#	... downtown.'
1	#	...downtown.'
1	#	Seven-eleven?
1	#	No, that's midtown.
1	#	...down town.'
1	#	...downtown.'
1	#	Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you. There are movie shows...'
1	#	How can you lose?
1	#	Hello.
1	#	Oh, hi.
1	#	Oh, you know what?
1	#	Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.
1	#	I forgot.
1	#	I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
1	#	No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can not disturb him while he's working. But I'm going down there in like an hour, if you wanna meet me down there. You know the place, it's on fifty-sixth street?
1	#	Hey, Tony.
1	#	Sure.
1	#	Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down here...
1	#	I really wanna...
1	#	How much money is this gonna cost me?
1	#	The washer fluid is fine.
1	#	Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm gonna bring it someplace else.
1	#	Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on my way.
1	#	Well, just get it down.
1	#	Okay. Thank you, very much.
1	#	He's bringing it.
1	#	Okay, thank you. (hangs up the phone)
1	#	They're sending a detective to my apartment tomorrow.
1	#	Well, I didn't count on my mechanic pulling a Mary-Beth Whitehead, did I?
1	#	He's a very special maniac.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	You know, like mechanic's pants, a shirt that said 'Tony'. Lemme ask you something, have you ever seen a case like this before?
1	#	Had I been taking...?
1	#	W-well, what does it matter? It's my car, I can do whatever I want with it.
1	#	Not that I would think of doing such things.
1	#	Well uh, whatever you can do. Thanks.
1	#	I don't get it. He assigns it to you, you don't do it. Somehow it gets done, and now he's telling you what a great job you did.
1	#	No. The police have no leads (sitting on the couch arm) and I just found out today my insurance doesn't cover it.
1	#	They don't consider it stolen, if you wilfully give the guy the keys.
1	#	They're looking.
1	#	Y'hello.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Yeah, okay. (to Elaine) They may have found the car.
1	#	Are there golf clubs in the back?
1	#	(indicating) This is Elaine Benes.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Well, what's going on? What is this thing?
1	#	Oh my God!
1	#	What is that smell?
1	#	Wait a second. Turbo? I didn't have a turbo.
1	#	No, it's a nine-hundred S. (happy) It's a turbo, Elaine, a turbo!
1	#	Hello.
1	#	Tony, where are you?
1	#	Tony, y-you better bring that car back!
1	#	Tony, it is my car, and I want it back!
1	#	Tony.
1	#	(exasperated) Where do I find these guys?
1	#	(answering phone) Y'hello.
1	#	Why, what's up?
1	#	Oh my god, you're kidding. (dives for his wallet) Hang on a second. (reading from his registration) It's JVN 728.
1	#	Oh my god. Yeah, yeah, he said he brought it to the country.
1	#	Good work Kramer, this is incredible.
1	#	Yeah, it's me. Kramer found the car!
1	#	It's somewhere in the country, they're following 'em.
1	#	I don't know. They're tailing him. I'm waiting for them to call me back.
1	#	Last check-in, they were still on him.
1	#	No, they won't call the police.
1	#	They're afraid they'll get in trouble for misusing a mail truck. Kramer doesn't want a record.
1	#	Not a Federal record.
1	#	What's going on?
1	#	Kramer, I want my car.
1	#	Keep following him Kramer. don't let me down.
1	#	How's the gas situation?
1	#	Duck, Kramer! Duck!
1	#	No, don't stop, Kramer. Keep going, don't let him get away.
1	#	(hearing the noises) What's happening!
1	#	(disappointment) Dammit!
1	#	Hairdo?
1	#	You look like Brenda Starr.
1	#	It's better than Dondi.
1	#	(Interested, still looking at the couple) Really?
1	#	You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.
1	#	Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
1	#	(Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.
1	#	Hi, Beth!
1	#	Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on?
1	#	Really?
1	#	Kramer?
1	#	Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. So.. (Goes for his coat)
1	#	(Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.
1	#	(Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different body.
1	#	Ehh, I dunno..
1	#	(His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
1	#	(Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car sick. I'm gonna vomit!
1	#	(Out of it) Huh?
1	#	I don't know, but we don't have much time.
1	#	The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting out that marriage.
1	#	It's like when tenant dies in a rent controlled building - you gotta take immediate action.
1	#	Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you do likewise.
1	#	But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
1	#	Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are we calling?
1	#	(Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."
1	#	Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.
1	#	What'd you say?
1	#	hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get there?
1	#	Slim-fit?
1	#	You're walkin' like Frankenstein!
1	#	Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have you told many.. people yet?
1	#	Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.
1	#	Sure, dinner would be fine.
1	#	What's wrong?
1	#	Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them off.
1	#	(Walks over and starts pulling on Kramer's pants) You just gotta wiggle your hips a little bit.
1	#	(Stops pulling on the pants) Alright, alright, That's no good. (Moves Kramer over to the couch) Let me try getting them from the bottom. (Goes for Kramer's Leg) Just gimme one leg.
1	#	(Still pulling on Kramer's pants from the ankles) Man these are tight. (Yanking) Squinch your hips in
1	#	(Still pulling) Squinch em!
1	#	(Stops) Alright, that's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. Let me just think for a second here.
1	#	Hold it, hold it...Look your gonna need the jaws of life to get out of those things.
1	#	(Kramer waddling out the door) Maybe you can soak in the tub.
1	#	Well, I just want you to know I'm there for you. Course now I'm here for you, but when i'm not here for you, i'm there for you.
1	#	So how did this all happen?
1	#	(stunned) Is that right?
1	#	Maybe, maybe
1	#	(agreeing) well three years is a long time to be married.
1	#	I'll tell you, that There for you crap was a stroke of genius.
1	#	Never mind
1	#	You're a Genius!
1	#	What's going on? You're the man of the hour, That's what's going on.
1	#	According to them
1	#	(moving over to block the door) Where are you going?
1	#	Talk to Beth?
1	#	You're not undoing anything.
1	#	Oh no you're not!
1	#	(talking to Beth on the phone) Could you put him on, I'd love to say hello.
1	#	George what the hell are you doing over there? I told you to mind your own business now stay out of my affairs!
1	#	Ate? What? What the hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, you get out of that apartment this instant. If you screw this up for me I swear....
1	#	What are you talking about?
1	#	Hey, are you still wearing those things.
1	#	See you later
1	#	Hello
1	#	(excited) Oh, Hi Beth
1	#	(under his breath) George.
1	#	Um. I'll call you back ok?
1	#	Trouble
1	#	George
1	#	ya
1	#	What are we gonna do?
1	#	Ya i could try and do that.
1	#	No you go on ahead, I'll take the bus.
1	#	No, no. I'll take the subway.
1	#	Na, uh, no, uh, I'll hitch hike.
1	#	It's really not necessary.
1	#	I don't feel so good.
1	#	Anyway Beth, you know i was thinking on my way over how when i was 9. I wanted these handball sneakers, they were all black but they came in adult sizes so you know i never got the sneakers. (Beth looks him confused)
1	#	I'm nauseous.
1	#	A little
1	#	It's not bad.
1	#	It's gotta have something to do with Kramer
1	#	What's coming?
1	#	Ahhh...The Day..
1	#	why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's over
1	#	Why not?
1	#	All right take it easy, just take it easy.
1	#	A letter.
1	#	That's it?
1	#	You can't go to China What about your job?
1	#	So write a letter.. move to another...move to Staten Island., 'lot easier to blend in a sea of people in Staten Island than China believe me.
1	#	Aagh! You come back for your clothes
1	#	So forget about your clothes.
1	#	Look, freedom with no clothes is a lot better than no freedom with clothes.
1	#	And what, hope for a crash?
1	#	You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to one.
1	#	Euhh...Elaine....
1	#	Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you . What could he do?
1	#	Does she hate cigarettes?
1	#	But you don't smoke.
1	#	You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's wedding.
1	#	Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester. I'll never see him again.
1	#	Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.
1	#	So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
1	#	See you ... me and Kramer...
1	#	(annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? Besides it's not a submarine and there's no room for a periscope in a car.
1	#	They're not making higher roofs.
1	#	Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't you understand It's stupid ,stupid...
1	#	.....Stupid , stupid.
1	#	Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
1	#	oh! thank you.
1	#	Well I...
1	#	What?
1	#	I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
1	#	Hey! Same initials . How do you like that?
1	#	No. I know what I want.
1	#	Yeah.,
1	#	Yeah!!!
1	#	Uh! Really .That's nice.
1	#	I think I'm in love.
1	#	No it's true. This woman saved my life. I was crossing the street .I was almost hit by a car...and then we talked and.......the whole thing just seemed like a dream.
1	#	No, no this woman is different , she's incredible. she's just like me. She talks like me, she acts like me. She even ordered cereal at a restaurant. We even have the same initials. Wait a minute, I just realised what's going on.
1	#	Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself! (Kramer is speechless) I've been waiting for me to come along and now I 've swept myself off my feet.
1	#	(shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the wedding
1	#	I just met her, she's incredible.
1	#	You can go with Kramer
1	#	Excuse me.( gets up and opens the door)
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Hey is the same thing as hello. What do you think Jeannie.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Yeah , she's coming to see my act tonight.
1	#	What's with you?
1	#	Something on your mind?
1	#	Looks like there is?
1	#	Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.
1	#	You don't like her?
1	#	What's wrong with her?
1	#	Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.
1	#	That's how it's gonna be.
1	#	Will you marry me?
1	#	I would like to propose a toast....Wait a second.. George! George Costanza come in here.
1	#	George, big news; I'm getting married!!
1	#	September 21st, first day of Autumn. Leaves changing colours.. Beautiful colors.
1	#	You see , I kept up my end of the pact.
1	#	Hey look , Champagne..
1	#	To our future wives....yeah...
1	#	Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.
1	#	(weakly) I dunno
1	#	(to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.
1	#	More cereal? that's your third bowl today, you had it for breakfast and lunch.
1	#	Thanks , thanks
1	#	Yeah , yeah .
1	#	I think I may have made a big mistake.
1	#	All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is; I can't be with someone like me.. I hate myself!! If anything I need to get the exact opposite of me....It's too much. It's too Much I can't take it ...I can't take it!!!
1	#	Yeah! Too bad.
1	#	Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.
1	#	They just took Susan to the Hospital
1	#	So she was just lying there.
1	#	Dead?
1	#	Yeah! me too
1	#	How did it happen?
1	#	So I guess , you're not getting married?
1	#	But....
1	#	Well , now I'm engaged..
1	#	Well I thought we'd both be getting married.
1	#	WE HAD A PACT!!!
1	#	Thank you, no.
1	#	I don't mind the cemetery.
1	#	Oh, I don't know. I told them her death takes place in the shadow of new life. She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her.
1	#	Star Trek II.
1	#	Right. Kramer and I saw it last night. Spock dies, they wrap him up in a towel, and they shoot him out the bowel of the ship in that big sunglasses case.
1	#	Yeah...
1	#	So it's over?
1	#	All right, so uh, let's do something later. How 'bout a movie?
1	#	Yeah, you in?
1	#	(to Kramer) So how's your karate class going?
1	#	...But with punching and kicking.
1	#	Alright, I gotta go to the airport to pick up Elaine.
1	#	She's been in Mexico for six weeks.
1	#	That was July 4th!
1	#	Alright, I'm outta here, and when I get back, I don't want to see you here (points to kitchen), here (points to living room), or here (makes similar circle with his hands).
1	#	Wow. So did you get any good ideas for the catalog?
1	#	Anything you couldn't have gotten tearing open a bag of Doritos and watching Viva Zapata?
1	#	No, I don't.
1	#	My what?
1	#	Oh, yeah, that. Well...
1	#	There's really not that much to tell.
1	#	See ya.
1	#	(continuing) No rejection, no guilt, no remorse.
1	#	I know, I feel bad about that...
1	#	Eh.
1	#	No.
1	#	Pride?
1	#	Well, you're your own boss now.
1	#	Go ahead.
1	#	Who's stopping you?
1	#	Whatever.
1	#	Oh God.
1	#	It's Dolores.
1	#	Mulva.
1	#	Hi, Dolores. George, you remember Dolores?
1	#	Yes, Dolores, I did. It didn't work out, though, Dolores.
1	#	See ya.
1	#	Yeah, so did I. You know what? I bet it was the engagement. I've shown I can go all the way.
1	#	Not our "all the way", their "all the way." I got the stink of responsibility on me.
1	#	You stink worse than I do!
1	#	Where?
1	#	Isn't it Myanmar now?
1	#	No, certainly not.
1	#	No one's gonna listen to you.
1	#	You're not qualified to work at the catalog.
1	#	Myanmar.
1	#	Sammy Davis had it.
1	#	No, she's not.
1	#	You guys both have class at the same time?
1	#	What do you mean you're in the same class?
1	#	Kramer, you're fighting children?!
1	#	He's nine years old! You don't need karate, you can just wring his neck!
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Actually, yeah. I'm meeting Mulva here in a few minutes.
1	#	Yeah. Was that a beauty or what?
1	#	No, no, no, it's... "She's not really dead if we find a way to remember her."
1	#	(stares into coffee cup and looks back at George) Problem?
1	#	Hey, board of directors. Look at you!
1	#	Before we go any further, I'd just like to point out how disturbing it is that you equate eating a block of cheese with some sort of bachelor paradise.
1	#	All because of Wrath of Khan?
1	#	Well, it was the best of those movies.
1	#	Well, that's the thing. It was completely mutual.
1	#	I am. It was the world's first.
1	#	Well, I can't argue with that, but the fact remains... I was completely... (to himself, cursing her) Mulva!
1	#	(answering) Hello?
1	#	Oh, I don't believe this.
1	#	Hey!
1	#	How's it look?
1	#	Huh?
1	#	Elaine, let me ask you something. When I told you my breakup was mutual, did you believe me?
1	#	I gotta do some research here.
1	#	Oh, I'm the doofus?
1	#	You know, it occurs to me that Kramer is at karate right now.
1	#	Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
1	#	Okay, question #8. What if I told you my fiancee left me for another man? Does that make me more likable, less likable, as likable? Let's start over here this time.
1	#	(on the phone) Dad, I wouldn't eat anything you caught in that pond out in front of the condo.
1	#	Uh, look, Elaine's here, I gotta get going. Oh, by the way, uh, I'm not getting married. Tell mom. Bye. (hangs up)
1	#	So... did you stop by the dojo?
1	#	How's your confidence level?
1	#	Self-esteem?
1	#	Doofus?
1	#	All right, so what? You put out the catalog. How bad could it be?
1	#	What is that?
1	#	Well, nobody sees the... cover.
1	#	What happened to you?
1	#	It's the new cover of the J. Peterman Catalog. It is Elaine's choice. Let's congratulate her.
1	#	Vaya con dios.
1	#	No, he's still stuck at the foundation.
1	#	Widower? Wait a second. (goes to a notebook of his research)
1	#	Hey, Georgie! I'm doing some research down at the coffee shop. Your story's the one.
1	#	Yeah, your widower story's tested through the roof. (various patrons give the thumbs up in approval) When are you getting out of there?
1	#	What do you mean you can't go? There's two really girls sitting at the counter eating grilled cheese. Cheese, George! Cheese!
1	#	He cleared his throat?
1	#	So?
1	#	Not getting it.
1	#	Oh, help me, Rhonda.
1	#	I gotta go meet Pam.
1	#	Okay. I'm just not ga-ga over her. For once I'd like to be ga-ga.
1	#	She's having Carol, Gail and Lisa over. You know they all have kids now?
1	#	Perpetuation of the species.
1	#	By the way, just for the record -
1	#	So, Elaine was telling me about this piece of whitefish she had the other day...
1	#	You know, if you really want to test him out, why don't you try the old Jerry Lewis trick?
1	#	I heard that when Jerry Lewis left a meeting, he'd purposefully leave a briefcase with a tape recorder in it. Then after five minutes, he'd come back for it and listen to what everyone said about him.
1	#	Yes, it is.
1	#	I thought you might.
1	#	Hi, sorry I'm late.
1	#	You know, if we rush, we can still make the movie.
1	#	Why do you invite these women over if they annoy you so much?
1	#	C'mon, you want to have a baby.
1	#	It's the life force. I saw a show on the mollusk last night. Elaine, the mollusk travels from Alaska to Chile just for a shot at another mollusk. You think you're any better?
1	#	How long did you leave it up there?
1	#	Play the tape, maybe we'll get a clue.
1	#	Is that it?
1	#	What do you make of it?
1	#	So, what's on your mind?
1	#	Pam? What about Pam?
1	#	You what?
1	#	Is that right?
1	#	What does that mean?
1	#	What about her name?
1	#	She's got really nice hair.
1	#	You've got really specific tastes.
1	#	She's got nice calves.
1	#	Maybe I could, you're making some pretty good points.
1	#	But I might.
1	#	Why not? The voice? The calves? The bacon?
1	#	I think I can! I even like the name! Pam!
1	#	Pam!
1	#	Pam!
1	#	That Pam! I am ga-ga over her!
1	#	Yesterday. Six-ish.
1	#	You just met the guy yesterday.
1	#	A barren, sterile existence that ends when you die?
1	#	Elaine, a guy'll say anything to get a woman.
1	#	I once told a woman that I don't eat cake 'cause it goes right to my thighs.
1	#	I just came by to tell you - I'm really, really happy about this relationship. Really happy.
1	#	Kramer!
1	#	Hello, Newman.
1	#	Pam? What do you care? (Newman shrugs. Jerry notices he's carrying a Brentano's bookstore bag.)
1	#	Wait a minute! (A manic chase scene ensues, with Jerry chasing Newman from one end of the building to the other. Jerry finally catches up with him in the hallway on another floor.)
1	#	Alright, Newman! This is it! (Shoves him against the wall.)
1	#	Why not?
1	#	I can't believe I'm losing Pam!
1	#	I thought we were talking about me.
1	#	Anyway, I don't need your help. (Turns to leave.)
1	#	Alright, Newman. What do I have to do to get you to stop pulling the strings for Kramer?
1	#	C'mon, out with it.
1	#	Elaine? What does she have to - (notices Newman looking up at him longlingly.) Oh no...
1	#	When did you build this thing?
1	#	And?
1	#	But we already knew that.
1	#	Just give me some idea of what you think it could be.
1	#	Please.
1	#	Hold it, hold it! You're right, I'm not ready for this. (The door buzzer sounds, Jerry answers it.) Yeah?
1	#	C'mon up. (To George) Alright, it's Pam, you gotta get goin.'
1	#	We were just playin.'
1	#	Uh huh...
1	#	Why can't I be a soul mate?
1	#	We're getting vasectomies.
1	#	It's a little short.
1	#	All right. How 'bout this one let's say you're abducted by aliens.
1	#	They haul you aboard the mother ship, take you back to their planet as a curiosity. Now would you rather be in their zoo, or their circus?
1	#	But in the circus you get to ride around in the train, see the whole planet!
1	#	(resigned) At least it's show business..
1	#	What if she's got no interest in you?
1	#	(dry) He knows.
1	#	(dry) He knows.
1	#	Why don't you try your engagement story?
1	#	Are you sure?
1	#	(doubtful) I don't know, do you have a--
1	#	Not bad. Wuh--what does she--
1	#	Pretty impressive--"Serious boyfriend '92 to '95." Owns her own car.. "Favorite president James Polk!" (ELAINE had echoed "Uh-huh. Yup." during it)
1	#	(hands it to him as he asks ELAINE) So how'd it go with Kevin? Did you, steel-toe his ass back to Kentucky?
1	#	Why would anybody want a friend.
1	#	I mean all that stuff is so small.. ((ELAINE is wryly assessing him)) stupid..
1	#	What?
1	#	Gillian. Hiii..
1	#	It's nice to meet you!
1	#	She had man-hands.
1	#	The hands of a man. It's like a creature out of Greek Mythology, I mean, she was like part woman, part horrible beast.
1	#	Would she have hooks?
1	#	Kinda cool lookin'..
1	#	(leaving too) Yeah. Yeah.
1	#	Right. Well if you need an extra set of hands, I know who you can call--
1	#	Kramer?!
1	#	It--eight o'clock in the morning! What the hell is goin' on?!
1	#	Why??
1	#	(disoriented) How long have I been asleep? What--what year is this?
1	#	(snaps fingers) Now that you mention it.
1	#	How much are they payin' you?
1	#	Really. So uh, what do you do down there all day?
1	#	All right.
1	#	W-w-wha' you got in there?
1	#	So the picture worked. Amazing!
1	#	I don't know, but you don't have it.
1	#	What?
1	#	(whispers) Damn.
1	#	Uh, here I guess, an' uh, uh I went out and picked up a paper.
1	#	So? What are friends for?
1	#	So he's Bizarro Jerry!
1	#	Yeah. Like Bizarro Superman. Superman's exact opposite, who lives in the backwards bizarro world. Up is Down. Down is Up. He says "Hello" when he leaves, "Good bye" when he arrives.
1	#	No. It's still a goodbye.
1	#	No.
1	#	Look. Just, forget it, (already). All right?
1	#	Tough day at the office?
1	#	Well, we better get goin' if we're gonna go to that uh, seven o'clock cold fusion.
1	#	No.. No thanks, I'm, just not hungry.
1	#	(to self) Oh. Twist off..
1	#	I can get it. (feeling his face)
1	#	I don't want to.
1	#	Okay. (closes eyes, blows on her finger, opens eyes, says to self) Didn't come true.
1	#	Then it does exist.
1	#	So when are you goin' out with this girl again?
1	#	So you're gonna burn that bridge.
1	#	So, uh. Gillian's comin' over later. I think I'm gonna end it.
1	#	Those meaty paws, I feel like I'm dating George the Animal, (steer).
1	#	Maybe I'll chain her to the refrigerator an' sell tickets.
1	#	Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!
1	#	I sit here for twenty lousy minutes in the morning--
1	#	An' then when you come home at night, you're always exhausted--we never do anything anymore!
1	#	(pause) It's your third day..
1	#	Well. (calling down the hall) Call if you're gonna be late!
1	#	Oh, I don't wanna talk about it..
1	#	Hey! Wait! Wait! Wait a second! Where you goin'? I-I hardly ever see you anymore.
1	#	The Bizarro coffeeshop?
1	#	I read.
1	#	(pause) Oh. Big deal..
1	#	(What's goin' on,) like yesterday, I go to the bank to make a deposit, an' the teller gives me this look, like--
1	#	(frustrated, to self) The whole system is breakin' down!
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	I wish I could, but, we're friends..
1	#	Good idea. (phone's ringing, goes to it) (muttering) There's a beach towel on the rack.. (to phone) Yeah.
1	#	(to drive him crazy) Who is this..
1	#	(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?
1	#	Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!
1	#	I'm right here. (note he has an athletic bandage on his right hand) You're late.
1	#	Like you care.
1	#	(calmly getting up with plate of chicken) Oh! Sure! Sure! You an' your work! Elaine's off in the Bizarro World, George only calls when he wants something, an' I'm left sitting here like this plate of cold chicken, which, by the way, (drops chicken into sink) was, for two.
1	#	(calm) I ordered in. It's still effort.
1	#	What's wrong?
1	#	You're probably gettin' an ulcer. This job is killing you! It's killing Us.
1	#	The coffeeshop?
1	#	(pleased) I'll call George!
1	#	Hey. Isn't that Elaine?
1	#	Elaine!
1	#	(quietly crept out) This is really weird..
1	#	I tried to get him one but Man-Hands almost ripped my arm out of the socket!
1	#	So this is it, huh?
1	#	(dry) I guess the DJ booth was over there behind the bone saw? (really disappointed) Let's get out of here George.
1	#	Why not?
1	#	What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.
1	#	No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.
1	#	You were livin' in the village then, right?
1	#	That is disgusting.
1	#	Well, then you're drivin' me wild.
1	#	(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?
1	#	Like with dogs.
1	#	He's gonna show up anyway.
1	#	Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
1	#	Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
1	#	Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?
1	#	Yeah I guess I do owe you.
1	#	No, I'm okay.
1	#	I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?
1	#	Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?
1	#	Elaine danced?
1	#	Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
1	#	For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.
1	#	And by then you've lost interest.
1	#	What made him get that thing?
1	#	Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)
1	#	I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
1	#	How could that be?
1	#	No, George was there, he said he had a great time.
1	#	Oh, what are you talkin' about?
1	#	Now you're talkin' crazy!
1	#	(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.
1	#	Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
1	#	Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
1	#	Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.
1	#	You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...
1	#	The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...
1	#	The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!
1	#	Half of show business is here.
1	#	That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
1	#	I'm a joke maker.
1	#	(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?
1	#	Does what?
1	#	May I see you outside for a moment please?
1	#	Outside!
1	#	What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
1	#	It's not legitimate.
1	#	Where did you meet this guy?
1	#	Kramer. (boom sound)
1	#	I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
1	#	Hey, what is going on over there?
1	#	Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
1	#	Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.
1	#	All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.
1	#	Oh man...
1	#	How was the rest of Death Blow?
1	#	Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!
1	#	You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!
1	#	What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.
1	#	What if I didn't do it right?
1	#	People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	What?
1	#	Well, I did the best I could.
1	#	I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
1	#	We're talkin' federal crime here.
1	#	No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?
1	#	Do you even know what this scene is about?
1	#	No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.
1	#	Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.
1	#	I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.
1	#	I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?
1	#	I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
1	#	All right, you're beyond stink.
1	#	And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.
1	#	Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.
1	#	No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.
1	#	You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em.
1	#	Kramer...
1	#	All right. That's it, I can't work like this.
1	#	I'm off the project. (He exits)
1	#	They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
1	#	Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters)
1	#	Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...
1	#	What?
1	#	Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.
1	#	What're we gonna do?
1	#	I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses!
1	#	Uh, well. It, uh...
1	#	Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured.
1	#	Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again.
1	#	But he's an old man, Elaine.
1	#	(Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot.
1	#	No you don't.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Thank you. (They continue walking)
1	#	I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal?
1	#	I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)
1	#	No. All you got to do is jiggle it with this screwdriver.
1	#	What are you doing?
1	#	Extra teeth. I love that look.
1	#	What mustard stain?
1	#	Why did you take a picture of a mustard stain?
1	#	I see. She's looking.
1	#	They've tried to fix it. But it keeps coming back the same.
1	#	Well I can't the warranty expired two years ago.
1	#	Well how are you going.....
1	#	I guess I would.
1	#	Not the gown again.
1	#	They have gotten to know you.
1	#	Why because you dress casual and sleep with a lot of guys.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Who's it from?
1	#	What if I don't want it?
1	#	Maybe I am.
1	#	I've never done it before.
1	#	Why not?
1	#	I don't know it was weird. Crazy printing. I don't know who it was from.
1	#	It's not totally impossible.
1	#	Why can't I be bombable?
1	#	I suppose you think your bombable.
1	#	There's more than a couple.
1	#	You don't have a Mercedes.
1	#	The driver seems a little put out.
1	#	Is that Burt Reynolds?
1	#	Oh.
1	#	That's a lot of skin.
1	#	You can barely see her face.
1	#	Where are you going?
1	#	Oh yeah I like this idea.
1	#	Hey
1	#	He went to get some steak sauce. Why?
1	#	Hello
1	#	Hello Leo. You don't have to yell.
1	#	How did you get my package?
1	#	I don't know what you should do with it.
1	#	I am not going to treat my uncle like a bomb defusing robot.
1	#	Open the package Leo.
1	#	Opening.
1	#	No, No bomb.
1	#	Oh stupid Leo was using one of those oven cleaners. He left the canister in there and the pilot light was on. The whole thing blew up.
1	#	Yeah but the explosion singed off his eyebrows, mustache everything. He's all smooth now. Look's like a seal.
1	#	Is this my stereo?
1	#	What happened to my stereo? It's all smashed up.
1	#	But you were supposed to get me a refund.
1	#	So were going to make the Post Office pay for my new stereo?
1	#	How is it a write off?
1	#	Write it off what?
1	#	You don't even know what a write off is.
1	#	No. I don't.
1	#	I wish I just had the last twenty seconds of my life back.
1	#	Still no luck
1	#	There's no Zorn or Zoutraph.
1	#	Hey what about Dr. Resnick My Uncle Leo is going to see him tomorrow .
1	#	He's not that good.
1	#	Oh yeah. This can't miss.
1	#	I don't like this Kramer. Will it be much longer?
1	#	Investigation?
1	#	Hello Newman.
1	#	Define rarely.
1	#	Are we about throw here Newman?
1	#	Actually I am quite comfortable.
1	#	No.
1	#	You can't prove anything.
1	#	No in a matter of fact it isn't.
1	#	I'm clean and you know it.
1	#	Where did you get that?
1	#	I don't know about that but I'm sure there is a explanation.
1	#	Okay.
1	#	Oh my god!!
1	#	I have some questions of my own.
1	#	The timeless art of seduction.
1	#	My friend Kramer and I were discussing that same thing the other day. He was with Brant-Leland for a while.
1	#	Mentor? You mean your boss.
1	#	Hmm. So Cynthia's your mentor.
1	#	Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.
1	#	Yes. And the mentor advises the protg.
1	#	No.
1	#	Respect, admiration, prestige.
1	#	I suppose if it was on the protg's way to the mentor, they might.
1	#	It's not a valet, it's a protg.
1	#	(checking out George's textbook) Risk management?
1	#	Well what makes them think you're a risk management expert?
1	#	Hello?
1	#	So get this book on tape.
1	#	Am I going? It was three nights ago.
1	#	Oh, it was a lovely affair.
1	#	You gonna do a little yelling?
1	#	That is so cool, can you put me on the speaker?
1	#	Hey, Copernicus?
1	#	So, what did you say?
1	#	What? What did you--
1	#	He's writing copy?
1	#	(reading) Jewish singles night?
1	#	Well why are you going?
1	#	What are you talking about?
1	#	Lomez is Jewish?
1	#	Kramer, you know, I--
1	#	I'm not really a duck fan, the skin seems sort of human.
1	#	Hello.
1	#	No kidding?
1	#	Bania?
1	#	Reading for the Blind?
1	#	So, I finally met the mentor.
1	#	Oh yeah, she's dating Bania.
1	#	Yeah. I had to spend two hours at dinner last night with that specimen.
1	#	Chicken, how could she look up to a person who voluntarily spends time with Bania?
1	#	Piccata, if anything I should be dating a mentor and Bania should be setting pins in a bowling alley.
1	#	Hey, good luck with that.
1	#	Kramer, how are you gonna cook Jewish delicacies for a hundred and eighty-three people?
1	#	Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe he's in line for another promotion.
1	#	What the hell is going on here?
1	#	What are you doing?
1	#	No, I don't want to.
1	#	Oh, this is awful.
1	#	Did you follow the recipe?
1	#	It tastes like dirt.
1	#	Kramer, you can't talk to Frank.
1	#	Yeah, it was alright.
1	#	No. No, no way, no Bania.
1	#	Have you seen his act? He's got a twelve-minute bit about Ovaltine. He's a punk, a patsy, a hack.
1	#	Would. Does. Is.
1	#	So you saw Bania's act?
1	#	I told you, it's like getting beaten with a bag of oranges.
1	#	He just thinks that anything that dissolves in milk is funny.
1	#	No more mentor?
1	#	Well at least you and I are okay again.
1	#	Why?
1	#	I can tell you what to do.
1	#	I can tell you what to think.
1	#	Oh.
1	#	Kind of in the middle of something here, George.
1	#	George?
1	#	I can't believe you feel you really need a mentor.
1	#	Yeah, see ya.
1	#	What's your problem.
1	#	Oh, hey Bania.
1	#	Oh, that's too bad.
1	#	Well it's just that you got so many things with the milk. You got that Bosco bit then you got your Nestl's Quik bit, by the time you get to Ovaltine--
1	#	George Costanza is your mentor?
1	#	About what? How to calculate five percent of a restaurant check?
1	#	As a matter of fact, I happen to have a protg of my own.
1	#	A Mister Kenneth Bania.
1	#	I'm gonna mentor this kid to the top.
1	#	Well, I don't think I want to date a protg whose mentor is a Costanza.
1	#	Have you tried the hamentashen?
1	#	Bania?
1	#	Risk management?
1	#	Hey, have you seen all these new commercials for indigestion drugs? Pepcid AC, Tagemat HB.
1	#	Now, you know you're supposed to take these things before you get sick?
1	#	No.
1	#	We're just talking. Is this not the greatest marketing ploy ever? If you feel good, you're supposed to take one!
1	#	They've opened up a whole new market. Medication for the well.
1	#	(hopeful) Then you admit it was amusing?
1	#	(thinking) Great. Thanks.
1	#	So when do I meet this jerk?
1	#	Who?
1	#	What song?
1	#	Desperado?
1	#	And you're still dating him? I tell you who sounds a little desperado.
1	#	(pointing toward the guy) See that salesman, twirling that umbrella.
1	#	I invented that.
1	#	When I started out as a comedian, I sold umbrellas. It was my idea to twirl it, to attract customers.
1	#	Elaine.
1	#	Elaine, please, it was a long time ago. The man doesn't want a history lesson.
1	#	I know Teddy Padillac. I worked with him on Forty-eighth and Sixth.
1	#	In his dreams.
1	#	(to Clicky) By the way, you're doing it too fast. You'll disorient the customers.
1	#	It's the twirling that dazzles the eye.
1	#	(as if speaking to a moron) Those belong to people.
1	#	(taking the envelope) Oh no, not more checks. They're coming faster than I can sign 'em.
1	#	I don't know why. There's a one-second clip of me in the opening credits of some Japanese comedy show.
1	#	(opening the envelope and pulling out a stack of checks) They run it all the time, and now I'm starting to get all these royalty checks.
1	#	Naw. Each one is for like twelve cents. It's barely worth the pain in my hand to sign 'em.
1	#	Why?
1	#	Ah, who are any of her losers?
1	#	I do it, I'm not even getting the cleaning.
1	#	Signed over a hundred checks this morning.
1	#	I'm gonna ask this guy something.
1	#	(to umbrella guy) Hey. Nice twirl you got there. You know who invented that, don't you?
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Super terrific carpal tunnel syndrome.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Ah, I'm one kind.
1	#	The Fleckman.
1	#	Right.
1	#	(not interested) Oh, I'm sure they are.
1	#	No. I'm fine, thank you.
1	#	(quiet annoyance) I don't write skits.
1	#	Oh, where you going? The coffee shop?
1	#	You look like you could use a...
1	#	No spiel?
1	#	So you're angry that this bizarre carpet cabal made no attempt to abduct you?
1	#	You know, maybe they thought you looked too smart to be brainwashed?
1	#	Too dumb?
1	#	(impressed) Well! Mack is back in town! Nice duds.
1	#	Sounds like you're throwing a lot of their money around.
1	#	What kind of show am I gonna do in Japan?
1	#	Forget it! The pilot was awful. It failed.
1	#	No. That's what makes it such a humorous situation.
1	#	(flexing his fingers) Sorry. My hand is numb.
1	#	(throws out his hands) What does he listen to? The all Desperado station?
1	#	You know, what you need is a song you can share.
1	#	Okay. So, is there any song that you feel very strongly about?
1	#	Witchy Woman?
1	#	(getting it) Ahh. Wit-chay Woman.
1	#	Hey. How was the Rainbow Room?
1	#	Ah.
1	#	What for?
1	#	I thought they all had suites at the Plaza?
1	#	Well, what about all that money from the kimonos I wear?
1	#	You have them sleeping in drawers?!
1	#	This has 'international incident' written all over it.
1	#	What is this?
1	#	Ah. It's a lovely little bureau and breakfast you're running. Well, I'm off to the bank.
1	#	(leaving) Konichi-wa.
1	#	(calls) Hey, I'll take one.
1	#	Teddy Padillac. Long time, no see. (pointing at the umbrellas) What've you got in a push-button mini.
1	#	Bailed? C'mon, you knew I wanted to be a comedian. Besides, we had some good time. Remember Tropical Storm Renee?
1	#	Aw, it was so many years ago. Who cares?
1	#	So, could I...
1	#	Could I just buy an umbrella?
1	#	(shock) What?!
1	#	Oh, hi Brett.
1	#	Ah, I didn't have enough money.
1	#	No, it's not that, it's the...
1	#	Oh no, look at the checks! Hours of hard work ruined!
1	#	No, it's not the money. It's my hand. It's crippled from writing and writing.
1	#	(bitter) Not at the moment, Brett.
1	#	(sarcastic) Thanks for stopping!
1	#	Boogeyman.
1	#	I'm quite sure. Anyway, any luck getting together on a song?
1	#	(negative) Eehh.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Really? They bought the butler character?
1	#	NBC?
1	#	Ah. But they told us we must go now.
1	#	Hey, George, do me a favour. If they make you an offer, whatever it is. (vehement) Just take it!
1	#	Who?
1	#	(to himself) Last one.
1	#	(agonised) Uugh! Ahh.
1	#	Yeah?
1	#	(kidding) Uncle Leo?
1	#	Alright, alright. I'll wake 'em up.
1	#	(to himself) Hmm, testy.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	It's stuck. (pained) Oww! The steam from the hot-tub musta warped the wood.
1	#	I'm trying. I can't get a grip. My hand's had kind of a bad week.
1	#	(looks round) Don't worry, I'll get you out.
1	#	(apologetically) Brett, I'm, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hit you in the head with.. an axe.
1	#	(defensive) At least it was just the handle!
1	#	Fleckman?
1	#	I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife fight for a citrus drink.
1	#	Restaurants too?
1	#	Yea especially Ziti, with that big hole.
1	#	Tell him forty and no fork.
1	#	How about we leave and, come back in a week?
1	#	Wow. Kenny Rogers Roasters. Finally open. Hey, look at the size of that neon chicken on the roof.
1	#	He is the gambler.
1	#	Try and stay calm.
1	#	Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?
1	#	You wanna grab lunch?
1	#	Seth, it's me. What's more important than catching up with an old college buddy?
1	#	Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we go to?
1	#	Hey whatever happened to Moochie?
1	#	Is that right?
1	#	Good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show in Japan.
1	#	No
1	#	I don't know. So what's this job of yours?
1	#	Mmmm.
1	#	The, the meeting you blew off?
1	#	Wasn't that kind of important?
1	#	You use a Water Pik?
1	#	So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what, two?
1	#	Hello. Anybody?
1	#	Hey. Why didn't cha get the big one?
1	#	I don't believe it.
1	#	Ahh, too bad you got a little, George Costanza thing going on.
1	#	That's a date?
1	#	How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?
1	#	That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?
1	#	(sings theme) "By Mennen."  What the?...
1	#	What's going on in there?
1	#	That light!
1	#	Can't you shut the shades?
1	#	Oh yeah? What'd he have to say?
1	#	Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?
1	#	I only knew you through Moochie.
1	#	Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)
1	#	How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)
1	#	Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?
1	#	What are you doing?
1	#	That, that's tomato juice.
1	#	I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....
1	#	..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.
1	#	Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.
1	#	Yea, that's no good.
1	#	How you gonna do that?
1	#	Seth?
1	#	I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.
1	#	But your were an executive, this is fast food.
1	#	That's not going to be good for anybody.
1	#	Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.
1	#	And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...
1	#	Oh no.
1	#	Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.
1	#	(Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.
1	#	(startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?
1	#	Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!
1	#	Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)
1	#	You know my friend Bob Sacamano?
1	#	Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.
1	#	No, but the difference is negligible.
1	#	Giddee up!
1	#	Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?
1	#	Hello Newman.
1	#	Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.
1	#	Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
1	#	It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it!  The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?
1	#	Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.
1	#	He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...
1	#	... as long as one of them is not him.
1	#	Uh-ha.
1	#	I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.
1	#	I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.
1	#	All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)
1	#	You got a little problem.
1	#	Hey Seth. Man it is coming down hard out there.
1	#	Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.
1	#	Home at last. Ahhhh. (light turns off)
1	#	Is someone there?
1	#	Mr. Marbles?
1	#	Why are we flyin' over the Andes?
1	#	Kramer.
1	#	No.
1	#	Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. It's better for you.
1	#	That's very nice, I guess.
1	#	Look, if other people are having some, I'll try you.
1	#	Can I have a piece of that?
1	#	Six weeks?
1	#	Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.
1	#	Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?
1	#	What guys?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor was debunked.
1	#	Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.
1	#	What?
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Oh hi, Katie.
1	#	I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.
1	#	Yes, all right, Katie.
1	#	Yes, bye.
1	#	Yeah, it's no big deal.
1	#	And you were integral.
1	#	I'm on next, right?
1	#	The guy with the lizard.
1	#	I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from career day?
1	#	So you're enjoying the not enjoying.
1	#	I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters)
1	#	Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.
1	#	It was a mix-up, I'm sure.
1	#	Now why would a junior high school want to screw with my head?
1	#	You can make all the laws you want, he's still gonna bother people.
1	#	No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) What? What is going on? What is that about?
1	#	But I was promised this slot.
1	#	Fire drill, can you believe that?
1	#	Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer enters)
1	#	Middle drawer.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Oh hi, Katie.
1	#	Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.
1	#	No, I don't have any ashtrays.
1	#	No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone)
1	#	Is this a repeat?
1	#	Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.
1	#	Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain. (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain consists of two parts the intellect, represented here (Pulls off tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats tiny piece of lettuce)
1	#	What is goin' on in there?
1	#	Why?
1	#	It doesn't?
1	#	All right.
1	#	Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in there?
1	#	I was out.
1	#	An assembly?
1	#	I understand. But what am I gonna talk about for two hours?
1	#	Superfreak?
1	#	...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.
1	#	How am I gonna fill two hours?
1	#	And give you the chance to see some real disappointed kids. (Waitress comes to table)
1	#	Are you all right?
1	#	Wait a second, I know what's happening. The no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.
1	#	To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. You're stupid.
1	#	Exactly.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	What? What happened to your face? It looks like an old catcher's mitt.
1	#	It's from all that smoke. You've experienced a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?
1	#	And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.
1	#	So what did you do?
1	#	But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor of sex, right?
1	#	You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual advances.
1	#	So you're never gonna have sex again?
1	#	So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?
1	#	I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework stinks.
1	#	How ya doin'?
1	#	Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.
1	#	What for? Oh come on.
1	#	I think it has something to do with me.
1	#	(thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.
1	#	Where have you been? You know, you're on next.
1	#	Got lost? We went to school here for three years.
1	#	Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
1	#	The Portuguese waitress?
1	#	Then what'd you come down here for?
1	#	It's good to have you back.
1	#	All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your home! (Audience boos)
1	#	Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow night.
1	#	Actually, it was a ********.
1	#	Jerry.
1	#	(Gets up) Get out!
1	#	(Looks around his apartment) Is it better than mine?
1	#	So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?
1	#	She's out.
1	#	Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those losers.
1	#	I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
1	#	(Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.
1	#	(Disgusted) What is with that?!
1	#	(Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) Where is your key?
1	#	You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space to you.
1	#	(Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail in here?
1	#	(Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?
1	#	Did you find out who stabbed him?
1	#	(Like a father) Well, you're not going near this hooligan anymore.
1	#	(Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. He could have been the one.
1	#	There is now. Kramer, you should really get that cough checked out by a doctor.
1	#	(In awe. Whispering) The botched it?
1	#	Hey. How's the new place?!
1	#	(Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.
1	#	(Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.
1	#	(Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the Cat Stevens.
1	#	Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman about getting that mail outta there?
1	#	Newman?
1	#	Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my storage unit.
1	#	(Confused) What are you talking about?
1	#	"Transfer"?
1	#	You quit the post office?
1	#	Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.
1	#	(Cheerfully) Well, a law's a law. (Leaves)
1	#	There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?
1	#	Mmm.. Bad how?
1	#	(Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
1	#	(Agreeing) What's more important?
1	#	You know, if this tenant board is so impressed with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing Tales of Costanza".
1	#	I mean, your body of work in this field is unparalleled.
1	#	You're the man!
1	#	I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment. (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to Newman by keeping the conversation with George going) So, you want a protein shake, or something?
1	#	(Angered) Hello.. Newman.
1	#	What's the difference?
1	#	Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.
1	#	You're giving up that easy?
1	#	(Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!
1	#	(Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from me!
1	#	(Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)
1	#	(Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home, Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to play with my toys.
1	#	"Big head" (Scoffs) That's almost a compliment.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Hey, George.
1	#	You can't make it?
1	#	Alright. (Hangs up)
1	#	(Saddened) Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.
1	#	Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for that?
1	#	(Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.
1	#	Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner with his dog)
1	#	C'mon. Just sit down!
1	#	Sit down! Sit down!
1	#	Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!
1	#	(Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog pills!
1	#	But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.
1	#	Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his coat)
1	#	I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands. You want to go?
1	#	(Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog) Huh? C'mon! C'mon!
1	#	Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!
1	#	Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying to pull him out of the car)
1	#	Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!
1	#	Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered? (Sees the pac) What happened?
1	#	Bit you?!
1	#	(Bravely) Well, what if I deliver it?
1	#	Well, why not?
1	#	What am I gonna wear?
1	#	(Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!
1	#	(Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!
1	#	(Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street, then keeps walking)
1	#	Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box, like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs - Do not bend".
1	#	What?
1	#	How did they know?!
1	#	(Pleading) I tried my best!
1	#	You know, this is your coat.
1	#	Boy, he didn't know what he was up against. (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?
1	#	What's the matter with you?
1	#	What giant freak-head?
1	#	So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing right into his hands!
1	#	(Casually, sarcastic) Either way.
1	#	So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the auto show, I waited for you, you never came.
1	#	Five minutes.
1	#	What's the difference? You never showed up.
1	#	Well, we barely knew the guy.
1	#	That's the way it works.
1	#	I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
1	#	That's enough. (They leave. George comes around the corner.)
1	#	How did you know about that?
1	#	He can't do that.
1	#	What happened?
1	#	Fantastic.
1	#	You're still doing that?
1	#	When you feel guilty.
1	#	What are you gonna do there?
1	#	Yes, I know, I know.
1	#	It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.
1	#	Is he from the future?
1	#	Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.
1	#	But it's your bodega.
1	#	You asked her out?
1	#	How could you ask her out?
1	#	I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens because you didn't want to go over the bridge!
1	#	I'll say.
1	#	Conjugal visit?
1	#	George is dating a convict.
1	#	Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?
1	#	Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?
1	#	I sense something is afoot.
1	#	Allow me. What are you, an idiot?
1	#	(sits up in bed) Oh what...
1	#	Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?
1	#	Who?
1	#	Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not, a chicken.
1	#	Well, you picked out a rooster.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	I'm not having money problems.
1	#	I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine!
1	#	You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!
1	#	Ma! Ma! MAAA! (Hangs up the phone in disgust.) Oh, ahhhh (sighs quietly)
1	#	Good.
1	#	I thought you were going out with Celia?
1	#	Having her in jail.
1	#	Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.
1	#	Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.
1	#	So he just shaves his head for no reason?
1	#	It's just hair.
1	#	It's brown.
1	#	So?
1	#	So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
1	#	Great! (realizing) What?
1	#	Ah ha...
1	#	Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.
1	#	It's inhumane!
1	#	It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
1	#	Yeah!
1	#	No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.
1	#	Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?
1	#	You let him fight?
1	#	How long do they usually last?
1	#	Great!
1	#	I'm too tired.
1	#	O.K. (Kramer leaves.)
1	#	Ah, I'm so sorry.
1	#	In other words, a normal relationship.
1	#	Well, she'll still be an ex-con.
1	#	Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll pick her up on something.
1	#	Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
1	#	New deal?
1	#	This is Outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
1	#	85 cents? That is Outrageous!
1	#	Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.
1	#	But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.
1	#	No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the cockfighter and be done with it!
1	#	Of what?
1	#	Kramer, give me that rooster!
1	#	Kramer won't sell.
1	#	Oh well, thank you, Marcelino.
1	#	You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
1	#	First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.
1	#	Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please leave.
1	#	We'll see about that. (Runs to the window and shouts up to Kramer, who's on the roof.) Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight to win!
1	#	Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. (Kramer picks up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.) Little Jerry is lean, mean, peckin' machine! (Kramer starts filling a pot with water.) What are you doing with that?
1	#	Hey, Kramer...?
1	#	Be careful.
1	#	Hey, guess what! Little Jerry ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!
1	#	I don't know. Where have you been?
1	#	Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!
1	#	Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Where's Celia?
1	#	hmm. (nodding head)
1	#	Hey, how's he doin'?
1	#	Look at the size of his bird!
1	#	He's a ringer!
1	#	Kra _ mer!
1	#	Well, I'm upset, but we'll make the most of it.
1	#	Huh. So, I guess your travel miles are about to expire.
1	#	Am I finally getting a baby brother?
1	#	What? The Cadillac I bought for you?
1	#	Aw, c'mon, you love that car. What about the Northstar system?
1	#	Well, it's a gift and I want you to keep it.
1	#	Wh..why didn't you tell me before you sold it?
1	#	(exasperated) Ugh.
1	#	Kramer.
1	#	We're in the middle of a discussion here.
1	#	You sold my Cadillac to Jack Klompus?
1	#	(getting worked up) I don't need the money.
1	#	(animated) Oh, is that what this is all about?! I bounce a cheque and you sold a Cadillac?!
1	#	(sits on the back of the couch) Oh my god.
1	#	Yeah, when it's your money, it's fascinating.
1	#	That Arabian is strong coffee.
1	#	What?
1	#	And you misinterpret this how?
1	#	I'm sure she was just being nice, buying you the coffee.
1	#	You're crazy.
1	#	George.
1	#	I'm flying down to Florida tomorrow.
1	#	They lied to me about selling the car. I'll lie to them about buying it back. They think they can dump six grand on me? Think again.
1	#	Excuse me?
1	#	Come on, your parents have money.
1	#	When did they ever spend any money?
1	#	What are their living expenses?
1	#	Where do they ever go on vacation?
1	#	Few hundred grand?
1	#	Course you may not see it for twenty years.
1	#	Does your father still eat bacon and eggs every day?
1	#	How's your family history?
1	#	Really?
1	#	So listen, I gotta go down to Atlantic City. I'm performing at Bally's.
1	#	(pulling on a jacket) They had a cancellation and they instantly called me.
1	#	Carrot Top. I told you, my career's fine.
1	#	I wanna buy back the Cadillac.
1	#	(reaching into his pocket) Alright, I'll give you nine thousand for it.
1	#	You bought it for six!
1	#	(standing) How much d'you want for it?
1	#	Fourteen thousand.
1	#	I got your message, (sitting) so I came straight from Atlantic City.
1	#	(extemporising) Well, I can't stay under my own name. I was registered under Slappy White.
1	#	Hello.
1	#	(quiet) Huh. Alright.
1	#	(extemporising) That was the Golden Nugget. Also in Atlantic City. They heard such good things about my show at Bally's, they want me for tonight. So I'll have to repack, and go.
1	#	I live in New York. (slams the cab door) What the hell happened?
1	#	What did you do?
1	#	(exasperation) You are such an idiot. Well, we gotta get the car cleaned up for my parents.
1	#	My car? You drove it into the swamp!
1	#	(smiling with pleasure) You know, that almost makes this all worthwhile.
1	#	Well, I uh, maxed out my credit cards, and I don't have enough cash for a hotel room. So...
1	#	Well...
1	#	You didn't like that crack about the pen.
1	#	Mmm-mmm-mmm. That means, if you still had those stock options...
1	#	Elaine, I'm sure George is just being sympathetic.
1	#	You're not alone. I'm practically broke.
1	#	No. But, I did blow over twenty thousand on that Cadillac.
1	#	Well, you seem happy.
1	#	Actually, I haven't heard from 'em yet.
1	#	The ocean called, They're running outta shrimp'?
1	#	(smiling) Really? That's great. You said that to him?
1	#	Oh. That's not quite the same.
1	#	I'm gonna grab a can of balls.
1	#	I need a can of balls.
1	#	No.
1	#	(reading) 'I, Cosmo Kramer, having just seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness, and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie, hereby want Jerry Seinfeld to remove my life support, feeding machine, lung-blower, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.'
1	#	Well, I don't if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.
1	#	Yes, well, of course, but, even so, you may wanna talk to a lawyer.
1	#	Yeah. (hands racquet to Kramer) I wasn't gonna get it, but this guy Milos, who runs the pro shop, he really recommended it.
1	#	In fact, it's the only racquet he plays with.
1	#	(accusingly) Hey, this is the zee page of my address book.
1	#	He called you?
1	#	To a guy you've never met? (mild sarcasm) Your screening process is getting ever more rigorous.
1	#	(pulling on a jacket) Mmm-hmm.
1	#	George used up all my guest passes already.
1	#	Come on.
1	#	(tossing the ball) Here you go.
1	#	(disbelief) Milos?
1	#	Elaine, I paid two hundred dollars for this racquet, because he said it's the only one he plays with. He could've played just as well with a log.
1	#	Kramer wants to die with dignity.
1	#	D'you get someone to take that Canadian quarter?
1	#	George was scarfing shrimp at this meeting, and this guy says 'Hey, George, the ocean called. They're running outta shrimp.'
1	#	(taps George's chest) Hey, here you go. 'Hey, Reilly. The zoo called. You're due back by six.'
1	#	Yeah, it's still got some spring in the strings.
1	#	Trust me, Kramer. Given the legal opportunity, I will kill you.
1	#	Hello Milos.
1	#	(animated) You know, I spent two hundred dollars on a racquet because I thought you knew what you were talking about.
1	#	You can't even play.
1	#	You could do that?
1	#	(indicating the woman) Game, set and match, huh Milos?
1	#	(animated) You know what Milos, I don't even care about the money. I just feel like I was taken by the worst tennis player I...
1	#	(doubtful) Yeah, you'll make it up to me.
1	#	Tennis, anyone?
1	#	Hello. Didn't I see you at the pro shop yesterday?
1	#	(to himself) Hoh, that Milos. (to Patty) Well uh, what shall we do, uhm, care for a cup of coffee?
1	#	(surprised) Alright.
1	#	(to himself) Gotta be an easier way.
1	#	So, you play tennis?
1	#	Not for me, I love chatting.
1	#	Who?
1	#	(shocked) Your husband?!
1	#	(explanation) He's new around here.
1	#	(walking away) Well, I didn't sleep with her.
1	#	(weary) Yes, George, because of society. So how did the big meeting turn out?
1	#	Ah, you're better off. Now you can just let it go.
1	#	You never really had the right comeback, anyway.
1	#	I didn't know it was possible not to know that.
1	#	Milos, I can assure you, I had no intention of telling anyone about your unbelievably bad tennis playing.
1	#	I guess that's a risk you run when you dabble in the flesh trade.
1	#	(reluctant) Well, I'll do it as long as there's no other girls around. I mean, I wanna be a man too.
1	#	So you hurt Vincent's feelings?
1	#	(taking the envelope) Wh..What's this?
1	#	(examining the button) Boy, look how far back it goes. It's like a tooth.
1	#	(nonplused) You're flying to Akron, just to zing a guy?
1	#	Too good.
1	#	You're on fire today.
1	#	(quietly) Hey, uh, Milos, I don't mind rolling over here, but could you lighten up on the 'not a man' stuff?
1	#	(quietly) I told you to cut it out.
1	#	He's been sleeping a lot. He's still groggy.
1	#	What happened to Vincent?
1	#	So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you this thing was good!
1	#	I know.. How about dessert?
1	#	Why?
1	#	What? Today? Really?
1	#	Yeah. And she picked the day!
1	#	No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun..
1	#	She's not Lincoln.
1	#	I'll pass.
1	#	Does it ever bother you that this organization-
1	#	is beating the bushes-
1	#	to basically give this money away-
1	#	to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?
1	#	Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone to ghost read it.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President Martin Van Buren?
1	#	Well, what does that mean?
1	#	(Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up?
1	#	Any messages?
1	#	They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out with her.
1	#	There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
1	#	No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!
1	#	Yeah?
1	#	Is he smart?
1	#	Hey! Just like you pretend to be.
1	#	I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!
1	#	Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?
1	#	Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that fell on the floor?!
1	#	I guess that's all right.
1	#	No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic! (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!
1	#	(Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.
1	#	So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants to be a city planner?
1	#	You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings, he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel.. we're all set for the weekend.
1	#	(To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen) With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if we want to! (George is disturbed. He gets up, goes go Kramer's door, and knocks. They talk) Four days at a beautiful bed-and-breakfast! I can't wait.. buy-bye. (Hangs up. George and Kramer come into Jerry's apartment, confronting him) What? (George takes the phone off the hook) What is this?
1	#	What?!
1	#	Where is this coming from? She's great!
1	#	There's nothing wrong with my career!
1	#	(Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any of this!
1	#	You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!
1	#	They were all like that!
1	#	Is my toaster oven on there?
1	#	Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.
1	#	Make them interesting.
1	#	Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.
1	#	Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.
1	#	I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right back tonight.
1	#	Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!
1	#	What?
1	#	(To his parents) So? What do you think?
1	#	I knew it! I'm not crazy.
1	#	(After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not so sure.
1	#	yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..
1	#	Well, it's not Daylight Savings Time yet.
1	#	(pause) I don't know, they just tell you the night before.
1	#	(under breath) Oh, I'm sure that won't cause any problems..
1	#	Oh, god, it's Mike Moffit..
1	#	I'm not a phony an' I don't want anything to do with this guy.
1	#	Fine. An' I'm not just sayin' that..
1	#	No openings in arson?
1	#	I'm feelin' a bit queasy myself. Maybe I'll see you in another five years. (casually leaves)
1	#	I don't see you as a Susie. Sharon maybe.
1	#	Who are you describing?
1	#	Named Sharon?
1	#	Kind of a Yankee prom?
1	#	You taking Allison?
1	#	Live?
1	#	Oh, lithe!
1	#	It can't be worse than this.
1	#	She wants to talk.
1	#	Nobody needs to talk.
1	#	What'd ya do?
1	#	(pause) All night?!
1	#	And she wants to break up with you..
1	#	Uh-oh. "Everybody breaks up at Pomodoro's."
1	#	You really like this girl.
1	#	You've made some Fine Exits.
1	#	So what do you do? You can't keep avoiding her.
1	#	What for?
1	#	But I don't want any "sweet action."
1	#	So you put down my money?!
1	#	Not (with) that, no..
1	#	George, pick up. I know you're screening for Allison.
1	#	So, coffee shop?
1	#	(ironic outrage) The nerve. Talkin' about ya behind your back--and right to your face!
1	#	No. No Suze.
1	#	Who are you describin'?
1	#	Named Suze?
1	#	Hey, I thought you went to the game.
1	#	Wait. Way--way--way--way--way--way--wait! Who?!
1	#	Hey--hey--hey--wait, wait, wait, wait! What happened!
1	#	Well--wait--wait--wait--wait! What do you mean "involved"?!
1	#	Can you believe that?
1	#	What--of course, without Reggie Miller, it's a blowout!
1	#	On what?!
1	#	Yeah, all right.
1	#	(not) Oh. Too Bad.
1	#	(singing) Believe it or not, Geooorge isn't at home.
1	#	Hey Mike.. How 'bout those Knicks?
1	#	Why not?
1	#	Mike. You say you're a bookie? You take a bet an' then you can't pay? I don't know, Mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say.. "Phony"?
1	#	You know, you're supposed to be the Bookie. Act like one.
1	#	(trying to shut the trunk hood) Something wrong with this trunk.
1	#	Well why doesn't he just come in?
1	#	Why is he scared.
1	#	Yeah, but--
1	#	It was an accident.
1	#	(hands up) I don't want it that way.
1	#	(whatever) Fine..
1	#	Ah, it's just a car.
1	#	(wistful) I don't know, I just see you guys together.
1	#	So Peterman bought it? I can't believe you got away with that!
1	#	Yeah, I know how you feel.
1	#	What?
1	#	Oh, the trunk's broken, it's rattling.
1	#	Well, there's only one thing to do. Eliminate her.
1	#	(firmly matter-of-fact) Get Rid of Susie. Make her disappear.
1	#	She's Gooone.
1	#	(impatient) Gone! (starts maniacally laughing) (briefly stops to point and explain) That bumper sticker.
1	#	(quiet) Where did Susie find the time to meet all these people..
1	#	(privately amused) Suze? I actually had a little thing with her for a while. (indicating Elaine) Her too.
1	#	(proud to Peggy, under his breath) Yeah, but he didn't sleep with both of 'em. (winks)
1	#	(smugly, under-his-breath) Not only that, I broke his thumbs.
1	#	Morning.
1	#	(applying paste to brush) Ah, baking soda. Annoying little product. 'I can do this. I can do that.' Why doesn't this stuff just shut up?
1	#	Ooh-ooh
1	#	So? She used the toothbrush!
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	How many years of med school did you have?
1	#	Jenna's like me. She's very... (searches for word)
1	#	I'll take fastidious.
1	#	What is that?
1	#	They don't actually have to squeeze his head to get him to say 'holy cow', do they?
1	#	Why didn't you pull over?
1	#	Bring it on. Nothing's throwing me at this point.
1	#	Oh, that adopt-a-highway thing.
1	#	Aw, looks just like you.
1	#	So what d'you have to do? Pay to keep it clean?
1	#	That old scam.
1	#	At the side of the road, with a pile of garbage.
1	#	You lost Phil Rizzuto's head?!
1	#	No.
1	#	Well, they're not here. You'll have to dig up your spare set.
1	#	So?
1	#	Well, I cleaned out their whole dental hygiene shelf.
1	#	By the time I'm through with her mouth, she'll be able to eat off it. Is it safe to drink bleach if you dilute it?
1	#	You didn't look down?
1	#	Poor son of a bitch.
1	#	It's a hundred thousand revolutions a second. It's the most powerful one they make.
1	#	The engine's made by McDonnell-Douglas.
1	#	Oh no, you keep going. It shuts off automatically.
1	#	(unheard by Jenna) When the battery runs out.
1	#	No, trust me, that one was doing more harm than good. Don't forget to use the Plax too.
1	#	I don't know anything about that.
1	#	That's the idea.
1	#	You know, maybe we better not. I, I think I'm getting a little cold. I don't wanna give you any of my germs.
1	#	She has a taint. I can't see it, but I know it's there.
1	#	Maybe if I could shrink myself down, like in Fantastic Voyage, and get inside a microscopic submarine, I could be sure. Although if there was something there, it might be pretty scary. Course, I would have that laser.
1	#	Being really clean and happy?
1	#	Disorder?
1	#	(thoughtful) Hmm, that could hurt me. (pointing out of window) Hey, there it is.
1	#	Nah, we've seen it.
1	#	What's with the signs?
1	#	Yeah, that stuff's all natural anyway.
1	#	Hey. So, keys?
1	#	I guess they leave that up to the general population.
1	#	Hard to say.
1	#	Yeah?
1	#	If you guys wouldn't mind, I would like to ward off dementia.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	Good. My cold's gone, and I've been looking forwards to kissing you, which I'm ready to do now, if you are ready.
1	#	Nothing. I just, I uh, I bruised my lip. I was drinking a Celray, and I brought it up too fast and I banged it into my lip, (lower voice and hurriedly) and then I knocked your toothbrush into the toilet and I wasn't able to tell you before you could use it.
1	#	I'm sorry.
1	#	Obviously never.
1	#	Kramer, I'm kind of in the middle of something. Would you get these signs out of here, please?
1	#	I wouldn't know where to start.
1	#	(knocking) Hey, Jenna. Hey!
1	#	What?! Wha... what'd you put in there?
1	#	Oh, man!
1	#	(into phone) Hello, Jenna, did you dunk the spatula? Was it the spatula? Hello? Dammit!
1	#	No. Could be anything. The whole apartment's a biohazard.
1	#	Yes, that is a definite possibility.
1	#	Are you just screwing with me?
1	#	Hey, how's life on the road?
1	#	I don't doubt it.
1	#	What's this?
1	#	Isn't that some kind of safety thing?
1	#	What the hell are you talking about?
1	#	(sarcasm) Yeah, in my toolshed, next to the riding mower.
1	#	One-Q? Whose apartment is that?
1	#	You're pretending to live in a janitor's closet, just to get this flounder?
1	#	Is the flounder here yet?
1	#	Nice. French doors'd really open this place up. Oh, but you have a slop-bucket.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Kramer's guys?
1	#	Oh that's nice, kind of a hard-labour fantasy camp.
1	#	I don't feel like eating.
1	#	Well, I thought it's about time we put aside all this silliness. I know now you didn't put anything in my toilet bowl. (pause) Did you?
1	#	Well, whatever. So, how've you been?
1	#	Good. (pause) Steak knife?
1	#	Nah.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	For what?
1	#	Dirt? That's alright, (for Jenna's benefit) because there's nothing wrong with dirt.
1	#	Grime, grease, filth, funk, ooze. Whatever it is, you take that stuff and put it right on my leather upholstery.
1	#	Sure. Bye.
1	#	There, you see? I just leant her my car, and she's gonna fill it with all sorts of... (he cracks) Alright! You win! That car was my last germ-free sanctuary. I slept there last night! Now, for the love of God, please, what is it? What is it?!
1	#	Toilet brush, oh (he pulls a 'Damn, shoulda guessed!' face). Alright, I can replace that.
1	#	Yeah. Let's uh, go to your place. Because I, threw out all my dishes.
1	#	That's true.
1	#	But, I'll tell you this much. I am never going to let some silly hygienic mishap get in the way of, what could be, a meaningful, long-lasting relationship.
1	#	I don't know what that could be.
1	#	Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.
1	#	Holy cow! Have a nice life.
1	#	You know at the movies, they show that little ad for the concession stand?
1	#	He's wailing on that banjo.
1	#	I just don't understand the raisinettes.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	The box of raisinettes runs up to the concession stand, buys another box of raisinettes.
1	#	Box of raisinettes eating another box of raisinettes? It's perverse.
1	#	Why's he dating a Pepsi? They're not having children.
1	#	Musicians. Get a real job.
1	#	(reading, unimpressed) Ohh, 'Number 1 Dad'.
1	#	(examining the label) Ooh, and it's in medium. Perfect.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Almost.
1	#	(reluctant) Kramer, I'm helping my parents move into their new condo. I'm gonna be busy.
1	#	(grudging) Alright.
1	#	(holding up the '# DAD' shirt) We're even.
1	#	(continuing to pack) That's a nice four seconds.
1	#	Maybe he has money.
1	#	(zipping up his bag) Sometimes you do.
1	#	(picking up his bag and coat) Who's she dating? Mr Peanut?
1	#	Stairmaster?
1	#	Nothin'.
1	#	Oh, did you get that outta my bag?
1	#	You know, I bought you a Cadillac. Twice.
1	#	I could, but I choose not to.
1	#	(protesting) I..I didn't say that.
1	#	(smiles) Actually, I am a comedian.
1	#	(jocular) Eighteen-fifties?
1	#	(reluctant) Mr Mandelbaum, I...
1	#	(consenting) Alright.
1	#	There. Alright?
1	#	(defensive) He egged me on.
1	#	He's eighty!
1	#	(smiling) Alright. Seven-thirty, got the place to myself.
1	#	Ah, you must be Kramer's guys. (indicating) Come on in. You got the cigars?
1	#	Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.
1	#	(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!
1	#	Cigars!
1	#	(incredulous) You're making your own cigars now?
1	#	(to Kramer) Hold on a second. (to Morty) Hiya dad.
1	#	They're Cuban cigar rollers.
1	#	What is that bubbling sound? Are you making your tomato sauce?
1	#	(accusing) You're not wearing a shirt, are you?
1	#	What colour is it?
1	#	This is quite a condo.
1	#	The crepe place?
1	#	(doubtful) There's crepe money?
1	#	(apologetic) Aw, Mr Mandelbaum, I just wanted to come by and tell you how sorry I was that you hurt yourself.
1	#	What?
1	#	Mr Mandelbaum, please.
1	#	I think I saw one a coupla doors down.
1	#	(disbelief) So she wanted you to come up, but you left because you thought some guy might be calling you?!
1	#	(pointing out the obvious) George, you've got Danielle. Forget about Neil. You've out-Neiled him.
1	#	I don't know, but you better keep it up.
1	#	(to himself) I try to take a vacation, I come back, the whole operation's a shambles. (answers phone) Hello.
1	#	I will, I just walked in the door.
1	#	Ma.
1	#	What?
1	#	So?
1	#	What's the difference?
1	#	(confused) We're talking about people, right?
1	#	I thought they smelled pretty nice.
1	#	Is not.
1	#	Is not.
1	#	I'm not having this conversation.
1	#	Am not.
1	#	Am not.
1	#	Again, Mr Mandelbaum, this back specialist is supposed to be the best. So if there's anything else I can do, please don't hesitate to, uh, try and find my number.
1	#	(humouring him) That's very nice.
1	#	Well, I don't know how official any of these rankings really are.
1	#	(surprise) This is your son?
1	#	(jocular) You got any kids?
1	#	(trying to defuse the situation) Look, no-one is lifting anything.
1	#	(under his breath) Oh no.
1	#	(laconic) We're already in a hospital.
1	#	(incredulous) You asked her to move in with you?
1	#	(musing) What if it's Neil Armstrong?
1	#	What if it's Neil Diamond?
1	#	Alright, I gotta go back to the hospital.
1	#	No, I got into a thing with the son, and now he's laid up too.
1	#	I think he's the same age as the father.
1	#	I dunno. It's like, if one of 'em dies, the other one wants to bench press the casket.
1	#	You're cold?
1	#	Something wrong with your chest?
1	#	(leaning round Kramer) Where?
1	#	Aren't they supposed to be rolling cigars?
1	#	Boy, they seem pretty angry about something.
1	#	I swear to you, I didn't know they TV was bolted to the table.
1	#	He couldn't handle the weight.
1	#	(placatory) Look, let me just state for the record, I think you're both better than me.
1	#	(incredulous) Oh, come on!
1	#	He was trying to lift the TV.
1	#	(consternation) Oh no. (to the bedridden two) It's go time.
1	#	Fellas, fellas, look, I gotta go.
1	#	(defensive) I didn't ruin your business.
1	#	(uncertain) Don't you hire people to do that?
1	#	(thinking) So, you just need some guys that could roll 'em?
1	#	(having an idea) I think I can help you out. I'll see you later.
1	#	Here.
1	#	He was gonna fire you?
1	#	Tunisia?
1	#	Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
1	#	(sardonic) Oh. (smiles)
1	#	Why are the crepes spraying?
1	#	That's good stuff.
1	#	Can you grab a nap at work.
1	#	So what are you doing now?
1	#	With a gentleman caller?
1	#	The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right at the other -person.
1	#	Shower?
1	#	A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little decision.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?
1	#	Drop one. . . . left!
1	#	A little less beady today.
1	#	Sounds like a really cool fort.
1	#	I'll tell you what I would like you to do with it.
1	#	He's kind of tied up here.
1	#	Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
1	#	So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	What happened?
1	#	How long did that last?
1	#	How was the movie?
1	#	Why?
1	#	So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
1	#	So what are you going to do with the mattress?
1	#	How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
1	#	No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get it done.
1	#	Just . . . do it.
1	#	Hi.
1	#	What is that smell?
1	#	You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?
1	#	How could you swim in that water?
1	#	Swimming?
1	#	(on phone) hello.
1	#	Who is this?
1	#	Why don't you just have him paged?
1	#	A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
1	#	I should have some reason.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Over here. You can see right through here.
1	#	It's kind of cozy.
1	#	Does it smell like the East River?
1	#	Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.
1	#	I don't think it's that bad.
1	#	No the stools go over there.
1	#	You mean they're actually doing the fitted hats? Cool.
1	#	Hey look at you.
1	#	No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
1	#	Could you at least get a hat for me?
1	#	Seven and five eighths
1	#	Why are you shouting?
1	#	Yes this is the terrorist bomber.
1	#	think I've changed my mind.
1	#	What?
1	#	I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders if the game was going to be rained out.
1	#	Yeah, that's right.
1	#	One second. Hello.
1	#	Just lie down.
1	#	All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.
1	#	Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't believe I got the Low Fat!
1	#	I saw it.
1	#	Okay. I wouldn't see it again.
1	#	I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."
1	#	No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.
1	#	Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist enters Monk's)
1	#	Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley.
1	#	What's up?
1	#	Excuse me?
1	#	Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
1	#	Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.
1	#	Booze is not a religion.
1	#	Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.
1	#	I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
1	#	What're you doing here?
1	#	Well this is very awkward.
1	#	Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.
1	#	All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)
1	#	George...
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?
1	#	I know, but...
1	#	5000
1	#	And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
1	#	I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)
1	#	Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
1	#	All right, take it easy.
1	#	How you doing?
1	#	Whatley. (Like "Newman")
1	#	So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic."
1	#	Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.
1	#	I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.
1	#	They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?
1	#	Poor Beth.
1	#	Oh screw him! (George enters)
1	#	But you yada yada'd over the best part.
1	#	George is already in there.
1	#	I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
1	#	Excuse me, Mother?
1	#	Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office hours?
1	#	Hmm, I really need to speak with him.
1	#	Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)
1	#	Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
1	#	Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.
1	#	No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.
1	#	And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.
1	#	Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father starts laughing) Father...
1	#	You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't you?
1	#	Newer magazines.
1	#	(In pain) Oh, are you about done?
1	#	Huh?
1	#	What about all your Jewish jokes?
1	#	The Jews?
1	#	Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
1	#	Date with Karen?
1	#	What happened to Karen?
1	#	Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?
1	#	So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.
1	#	What?
1	#	Kramer, he's just a dentist.
1	#	I am not an anti-dentite!
1	#	They do have their own schools!
1	#	Well, what's wrong?
1	#	Talk to me.
1	#	Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.
1	#	Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.
1	#	Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)
1	#	I'm kinda in the middle of something.
1	#	Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.
1	#	Beth and Arnie broke up.
1	#	(Shaking his head no) Pff.
1	#	Hey, where's Marcy?
1	#	Hey, Kramer, over here.
1	#	Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.
1	#	Very handsome.
1	#	Hi, Mr. Abbott.
1	#	Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all out of proportion.
1	#	What?
1	#	That's a good one. Dentists.
1	#	She went out to get her head shaved.
1	#	Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
1	#	Me neither. I love the previews. In fact I enjoy being in the theatre cut up(?). Last week after a preview, I yelled out 'Must miss'.
1	#	Yeah, it got a good laugh. Let me just check my messages before we go.
1	#	After two dates!
1	#	Seven.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	You're gonna keep these here for eight months?!
1	#	Kramer, you're gonna leave these chairs here for two and a half years?!
1	#	What for?
1	#	Really, why d'you think they're taking you out to lunch?
1	#	I don't mind the Mayans.
1	#	Kramer, these balloons aren't gonna stay filled till New Year's!
1	#	Hi. Sorry I'm late. There's a lotta chairs and balloons in my apartment. How 'bout I make it up to you with dinner?
1	#	Yeah, I'm sorry about that Mongolian barbecue last night. I'd heard good things.
1	#	Lemme just check my messages. (to himself) Maybe a nicer girl called.
1	#	Hello? Who's this?
1	#	Seven?
1	#	Good meeting?
1	#	You can do that.
1	#	So you want to go out in a final blaze of incompetence?
1	#	So, George...
1	#	(rising) I had like a so-so date with Valerie, now I'm number nine on the speed-dial.
1	#	So? I used to be seven. I dropped two spots.
1	#	Yeah, this speed-dial's like a relationship barometer.
1	#	Well, I just wanted to... (breaks off) You forgot the gift certificate to Barnes and Noble.
1	#	(resumes) ...you know, make a good impression.
1	#	I like the way you think.
1	#	Oh my God! Number one!! Seinfeld, you magnificent bastard!
1	#	Some of us.
1	#	Hola.
1	#	What is all this?
1	#	Ah, no wonder we're getting so much rain.
1	#	Hi Valerie.
1	#	You're not Valerie.
1	#	But, I never...
1	#	You know uh, Valerie, I uh, couldn't help but notice that I'm on your speed-dial.
1	#	But I can't help thinking that maybe there's someone in your life who deserves it more. Someone you've known, you know, more than a week.
1	#	What? No.
1	#	Yikes!
1	#	How could they not fire you?
1	#	Aw, come on there now.
1	#	Nonsense. You do everything wrong.
1	#	Everything.
1	#	Absolutely. I have no confidence in you.
1	#	That's the spirit. You suck!
1	#	Well, Mrs Hamilton, it's certainly nice that you and Valerie patched things up, so we could all get together like this. Where is Valerie?
1	#	Okay.
1	#	Uh, good.
1	#	(nervous) What?
1	#	I don't know, Mrs Hamilton. That doesn't sound...
1	#	Valerie's not coming over, is she?
1	#	No...
1	#	Stop, stop. This isn't right. What about Valerie?
1	#	(leaving hurriedly) Wuhh...
1	#	Oh my God, George!
1	#	Kramer, look, it's George.
1	#	(neutral) Fine.
1	#	(neutral) No problem.
1	#	What're you doing with a pricing-gun?
1	#	(to himself) Still a rip-off.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Uh, well, she uh, probably just wanted to be able to keep tabs on you.
1	#	Hold on a second.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Oh, Mrs Hamilton, this is a very bad time. I've got Valerie on the other line. Just a second.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Well...
1	#	Hang on.
1	#	She knows about the speed-dial. Mrs Hamilton, you gotta get me off this thing.
1	#	Hang on.
1	#	She wants to be back on yours.
1	#	Hang on.
1	#	Fine, if I'm off yours.
1	#	Sorry. Hang on.
1	#	Fine, if I'm off yours.
1	#	Please, Mrs Hamilton, this is very awkward for me.
1	#	(hurried) Great, bye.
1	#	She said she'll do it.
1	#	Hang on.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	She never sees the big picture.
1	#	Hello, Newman!
1	#	No.
1	#	By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?
1	#	Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.
1	#	Aww!
1	#	Hello?
1	#	It's Jerry. Who's this?
1	#	Oh, hi Valerie. What's up?
1	#	Wow, poison control? That's even higher than number one!
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
1	#	Let's go.
1	#	For how long?
1	#	Come on.
1	#	I'm going to be this guy's friend.
1	#	New clothes?
1	#	Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!
1	#	He asked you to watch them not wear them.
1	#	You look like a tourist.
1	#	When you hear like a soft russeling.
1	#	Oh right, the new job, how is it?
1	#	So who's the new you?
1	#	Oh hi Alex.
1	#	No.
1	#	Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.
1	#	(yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
1	#	Hmm. That looks new.
1	#	(uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.
1	#	(uncomfortably) Nothing.
1	#	I did something stupid.
1	#	Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched voice) Gone.
1	#	Well women do it.
1	#	Well what am I going to tell Alex?
1	#	Um hum.
1	#	Hey!
1	#	You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. I mean it's hard enough...
1	#	Really?
1	#	So you're pretending to be a tourist?
1	#	How do you explain your apartment?
1	#	you moved into a hotel?
1	#	So get this we're in the park today Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.
1	#	So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not another.
1	#	Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.
1	#	The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is reality.
1	#	You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you all the time now.
1	#	What is it she think you can't do?
1	#	How did you do those things?
1	#	Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?
1	#	"The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.
1	#	Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
1	#	Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
1	#	What? Can't I get a moment's peace?
1	#	I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
1	#	Oh that's an old wives tale.
1	#	Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen to me.
1	#	Why do I have to go on the tour?
1	#	Hey, how's business?
1	#	You also shouldn't use a donut.
1	#	Can we just go?
1	#	You know I never though he would be able to recreate the experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.
1	#	What's that?
1	#	Oh. Yeah.
1	#	(in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I can't let her see me scratch it.
1	#	I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.
1	#	I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with that dog.
1	#	(for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.
1	#	Nah, you had a good run. Took them to the World Series.
1	#	Don't sell yourself short. You made all the flight arrangements, hotels, busses.
1	#	So, when you actually did work, what it was that you did?
1	#	Maybe I should ask her out?
1	#	That's true. Maybe I take her to the Tony's.
1	#	Yeah, I wrote some jokes to the show and they gave me two tickets.
1	#	They're musicians. That's not a joke.
1	#	They did it for three years. What's another few months.
1	#	Like what?
1	#	I've always wanted to do that...
1	#	You mean golf?
1	#	Like this? (imitates the walk)
1	#	That's so strange.
1	#	Oh, what about 'ladies night'? Women admitted free before 10?
1	#	Reer.
1	#	Boy, your really packing it all in.
1	#	Like what?
1	#	Stomach ache?
1	#	Aah, top of the fridge. Hey George, I'm taking that waitress to the Tony's.
1	#	Where are you sitting?
1	#	What academy?
1	#	Hi!
1	#	Thanks, it's a breakaway.
1	#	Absolutely.
1	#	Ok...
1	#	Thanks, Lyle...
1	#	So, you and Lyle are roommates?
1	#	Gay?
1	#	Is he gay?
1	#	Are you sure?
1	#	(to himself) This is a new one.
1	#	Yeah, when I went to pick her up there was this dude.
1	#	What do you think it could've been just some dude?
1	#	I reckon.
1	#	Dude!
1	#	It's 1030 in the morning?
1	#	So, has the summer of George already started or are you still de-composing?
1	#	You didn't give that thing back?
1	#	That's because you didn't win.
1	#	You haven't even seen it.
1	#	Hi!
1	#	No rush.
1	#	(to himself) I have absolutely no idea.
1	#	..except that the dude plays the showroom and I'm stuck doing food and beveridged!
1	#	It's Kramer.
1	#	George says hi.
1	#	Why don't you just come over?
1	#	He's looking on to fridgerator.
1	#	I can't do this.
1	#	He's not doing anything. Goodbye!
1	#	Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?
1	#	Oh, hello.
1	#	All right, all right.
1	#	I said no! (hangs up the phone.)
1	#	Just me? No dudes or fellas?
1	#	I can start right away.
1	#	But not here. (They leave.)
1	#	I can't believe how much we did this afternoon. I have friends who this would've be their whole life.
1	#	Eh, what?
1	#	Oh yeah, Sfuzi? I- I've gotta do that.
1	#	Sure.
1	#	The one with the...(mumbles.)
1	#	Ok, ok...
1	#	No, I'll crab it.
1	#	What, did you lose your remote?
1	#	It's Lanette! I need an assistant or intern or something.
1	#	Not.
1	#	No, because that's...
1	#	Here.
1	#	I'm trying.
1	#	Then each of us would only have be like a half man. That sounds about right!
1	#	Why they want you to fire Raquel Welch?
1	#	She seems very nice.
1	#	I'm in show business.
1	#	I've got a tape of 'Fantastic voyage' if you think that would help.
1	#	Did you tell Peterman about this?
1	#	Because men think if women are grabbing and clawing at each other there's a chance they might somehow kiss.
1	#	You got the tickets?
1	#	I like it.
1	#	What?
1	#	Hey George, one second, she's having a party friday night and she wants me to take care of the invitations.
1	#	35, and George, on the invitations...
1	#	I like your nails, that is a great color.
1	#	This old thing?
1	#	Ok, let's towel it up.
1	#	But we're in towels.
1	#	all right. One second.
1	#	George, where are those invitations? You were supposed to leave them with her doorman!
1	#	No. (Lanette leaves.) Did you at least pick them up?
1	#	Ok, get them over here pronto. We're in towels here George.
1	#	...what?
1	#	All right, that's not bad. Now get over here!
1	#	I don't know. They don't tell me anything. What's that? (Kramer holds a broken Tony)
1	#	What happened to you?
1	#	Yikes.
1	#	What happened to you?
1	#	Cat fight with Raquel Welch.
1	#	Back on the rack.
1	#	I think we're still a man short.
1	#	Yeah...
1	#	(also wearing a moustache) What do you mean, 'what is it?' It's a country right next to Belgium.
1	#	Holland *is* the Netherlands.
1	#	(picking at his moustache) You know I cannot stand this thing anymore.
1	#	I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.
1	#	Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation from ourselves. That's what you said.
1	#	No.
1	#	Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a job.
1	#	No more crutches, that must be a relief.
1	#	Not with a cane?
1	#	That is a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. Some guy from NBC saw my set, he wants me to do a showcase. I might have another shot at a pilot.
1	#	We? No.
1	#	Killed?
1	#	Yeah, killed. Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like that fish that attaches himself to the shark.
1	#	Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.
1	#	Well, I'm glad I brought it up.
1	#	(looking at Kramer's moustache) Uh, we're not doing that anymore.
1	#	What?
1	#	So what's this job?
1	#	Knicks? Rangers?
1	#	Welcome back to the show.
1	#	No.
1	#	What kind do you use?
1	#	(nods) Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe.
1	#	Remember David Puddy?
1	#	Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the top of the order.
1	#	Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched the floor of a men's room. That's the end of that.
1	#	He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. He's a time slot hit.
1	#	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
1	#	Do I have to ask?
1	#	Why are you buttering your face?
1	#	Oh Moses smell the roses.
1	#	No.
1	#	I don't want to.
1	#	(places two slices of bread against Kramer's face) That is close.
1	#	You got the job?
1	#	Hold on, they think you're handicapped?
1	#	How can you do this?
1	#	He drove a car with no arms?
1	#	Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I know you?
1	#	You can eat it?
1	#	Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna.
1	#	The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
1	#	I don't believe this.
1	#	No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything off me, first laughs now ladies.
1	#	Someone's cooking.
1	#	Hello, Newman.
1	#	(cutting in) I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman.
1	#	No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter (pauses) Oh no!
1	#	Kramer!
1	#	Look at your skin.
1	#	Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for that?
1	#	Is that what the doctor said?
1	#	Yea.
1	#	Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with you?
1	#	What happened?
1	#	Oh no, not you too?
1	#	You know what's good for that? Relish.
1	#	Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! No!!! Thank you. (Hangs up.) I don't believe this. They've added Bania to the network showcase and he's going on right after me.
1	#	Oh, like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? Shopping carts with one bad wheel?
1	#	You think that's funny?
1	#	You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
1	#	Oh, I'm gonna puke.
1	#	You mugged Stephen Hawking?
1	#	Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight to hell at no more than three miles an hour.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?
1	#	Who's that?
1	#	Who?
1	#	Get me some duty free Kahlua.
1	#	Sounded good.
1	#	Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by the big showcase tonight.
1	#	That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little off.
1	#	That's right, I'm taking a dive.
1	#	I'm laying down! Then we'll see how he does up there, without all the assistance.
1	#	We're four months apart.
1	#	That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without the cushy timeslot.
1	#	If you'll excuse me.
1	#	(OC) Hey everybody! Who's ready to laugh?
1	#	What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, why do you want shade?
1	#	And what's with people getting sick?
1	#	I mean, what's the deal with cancer?
1	#	What are you talking about? I bombed!
1	#	Like who?
1	#	He *had* cancer!
1	#	Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.
1	#	Ah, the sweet stench of failure.
1	#	Ouch.
1	#	What?
1	#	Oh, I'm gonna puke.
1	#	So youre staying at Play Now?
1	#	But they not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?
1	#	Oh, its just this stupid thing.
1	#	(doing the voice) No-o-o-o.
1	#	All right. You know this girl Clare I am seeing?
1	#	Well, he and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays awake all night and talks to me.
1	#	Well, her belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. Talk to me.
1	#	Hey, look whose here - Puddy.
1	#	And yet he continues to live.
1	#	Well, thats it. You two are back together.
1	#	The bump into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.
1	#	Elaine, breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, and then it goes over.
1	#	Thats different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, youll backslide
1	#	Stakes?
1	#	Dollars?
1	#	Done.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	I went to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!
1	#	Oh yes, quite.
1	#	Of course its a sliding scale.
1	#	(doing the voice) La la la.
1	#	Oh, that restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a good idea.
1	#	Which part? The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending the two hundred million you dont have part?
1	#	No resources, no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.
1	#	I can ball park it.
1	#	Hey, I called you last night, where were you?
1	#	George?
1	#	Well, I was here, thats everyone (laughing).
1	#	Are those the same shoes as yesterday?
1	#	Your hair, its somewhat de-poofed.
1	#	Wait a second, whats going on here?
1	#	(screams).
1	#	Youre wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!
1	#	Hand it over. Pay up.
1	#	Then what do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and have sex. This isnt cinemax.
1	#	Ah, dinner! Thats it, youre all the way back!
1	#	Sex, thats meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. Thats like an hour.
1	#	And you are?
1	#	Whos he?
1	#	Alright.
1	#	But you only provide fantasy world corporate experience.
1	#	Alright, its time to go.
1	#	(sarcastically) I know!
1	#	Actually, that is not a bad idea.
1	#	Now, its time to go.
1	#	Hello
1	#	(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?
1	#	So, are you going to leave?
1	#	I thought youre like Hitler in the bunker?
1	#	Im getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers call) Hello!
1	#	(looking shocked) Really? When?
1	#	No, I dont.
1	#	Hey! So, wheres my money?
1	#	Oh yeah, hold on.
1	#	Hello Darren, this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused). Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking confused) What do you mean hes already left?
1	#	Hey, Elaine is going to come with us, alright?
1	#	Well, just
1	#	Do you have to write all this stuff down.
1	#	So, how hot did it get?
1	#	I guess you can take anything, but actual work.
1	#	(doing the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!
1	#	Oh that makes a lot of sense.
1	#	(giggling)
1	#	Oh, nothing. (still giggling)
1	#	Oh all right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing this silly, dumb voice.
1	#	No, its not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
1	#	No its
1	#	Hey, were kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back later?
1	#	(Screams) GET OUT!
1	#	No body said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade guy.
1	#	No, hes just a little bloated.
1	#	Its mostly water weight.
1	#	Line two?
1	#	Oh
1	#	So youre sure youre not still angry about last night?
1	#	Never?
1	#	What about if youre not around?
1	#	So I have to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?
1	#	I can do that.
1	#	I dont know.
1	#	(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)
1	#	So we could do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?
1	#	No, it can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o.
1	#	Really?
1	#	(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.
1	#	See, never bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.
1	#	No, I dont think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable. Its kismet.
1	#	Done.
1	#	Youre in there again.
1	#	What is this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit him).
1	#	Yeah. Nine oclock.
1	#	(doing the voice) Good-bye Kramer.
1	#	Really?
1	#	(on the phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice. Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye bye.
1	#	Trouble down at the plant?
1	#	I understand (not really understanding, lol).
1	#	Youre not
1	#	Go again?
1	#	Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.
1	#	They got away.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Yeah, I put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest, and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.
1	#	I cant. I got to meet Clare.
1	#	Yeah, I thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.
1	#	Darren?
1	#	Uh, bathroom.
1	#	I thought it was open to the public.
1	#	Wow! Zanadu . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) May I?
1	#	Wow! Hey, theres Clare. I better go down.
1	#	Theres the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!
1	#	This is going to be a shame.
1	#	Clare won her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. I guess youre not going in anymore.
1	#	So theyre not paying you your
1	#	So youre pretty much
1	#	What ever happened to Darren?
1	#	So Clare sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil
1	#	Im just so glad its back.
1	#	Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.
1	#	What? All right, fine.
1	#	No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.
1	#	I get peeved.
1	#	Miffed.
1	#	Irked?
1	#	She says I suppress my emotions.
1	#	Good body.
1	#	But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.
1	#	Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!
1	#	Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.
1	#	Fix a screen door in Queens.
1	#	Not goin' to the Knick game.
1	#	You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.
1	#	Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!
1	#	1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!
1	#	You're damn right you're not buying it!
1	#	I'm open. There's just nothing in there.
1	#	Oh, you think I'm lying about this?
1	#	Well, I'm not.
1	#	Oh, stop it.
1	#	That's enough!
1	#	Really? It felt good.
1	#	Tongue?
1	#	Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.
1	#	Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.
1	#	Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?
1	#	Good.
1	#	What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel cage death match.
1	#	What do you need it for?
1	#	(Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer home? Oh, hey.
1	#	Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.
1	#	You barbecuing tonight?
1	#	So, where do you want to eat tonight?
1	#	Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?
1	#	Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!
1	#	Maybe'!?
1	#	Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)
1	#	Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!
1	#	That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.
1	#	It's Patty.
1	#	(Crying) What--what is this salty discharge?
1	#	This is horrible! I care!
1	#	Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.
1	#	I don't know what's happening to me.
1	#	That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.
1	#	You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?
1	#	Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. Ever tell you how much I love you?
1	#	I love you, George. Come here.
1	#	Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.
1	#	Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!
1	#	I love you, Costanza.
1	#	What happened to you, pal?
1	#	Are you all right?
1	#	So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?
1	#	Sit down, Elaine.
1	#	I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.
1	#	Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.
1	#	Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...
1	#	When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been right in front of us!
1	#	Elaine...
1	#	I'm asking Elaine to marry me.
1	#	Elaine?
1	#	Lippman?
1	#	Can I help you?
1	#	What happened here, Kramer?
1	#	Kramer!
1	#	You don't look well.
1	#	Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.
1	#	He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?
1	#	George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?
1	#	Yikes. Well, good look with all that.
1	#	I think you scared me straight.
1	#	What?
1	#	I tell ya, I don't see it happening.
1	#	He doesn't work here anymore.
1	#	(Leaving) Right back at ya, Slick.
1	#	Are you sure you can't stay longer?
1	#	He was 96 years old.
1	#	Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.
1	#	Really?
1	#	Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?
1	#	Did you give blood?
1	#	In case of what?
1	#	Are we finished?
1	#	Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is who's responsible for this?
1	#	What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?
1	#	What?
1	#	Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?
1	#	Elaine, what do you think?
1	#	Didn't go for it, huh?
1	#	So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
1	#	Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
1	#	Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.
1	#	I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.
1	#	What the hell is that?
1	#	Oh, why?
1	#	What, it...it's here in the building?
1	#	No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.
1	#	You know it and I ditched all my junk food.
1	#	Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.
1	#	Is this about me?
1	#	Oh, then I lost interest.
1	#	Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.
1	#	Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?
1	#	What is this?
1	#	What about this? This is blood isn't it?!
1	#	Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!
1	#	Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?
1	#	Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...
1	#	Aaah...
1	#	Aah!
1	#	I can see that! What happened?
1	#	I'll remember that.
1	#	What?
1	#	I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.
1	#	So, how's the fornicating gourmet?
1	#	George, we're trying to have a civilization here.
1	#	Hey, how was baby-sitting?
1	#	Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.
1	#	Really?
1	#	I'm not touching that thing.
1	#	Oh, no...
1	#	Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.
1	#	All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Kramer called you?
1	#	Yes, I'm fine.
1	#	I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.
1	#	Why are you calling my parents?
1	#	Why here?
1	#	Ok...
1	#	Fine...
1	#	No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!
1	#	All right.
1	#	Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?
1	#	Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?
1	#	Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?
1	#	For what?
1	#	How many session did my parents paid for?
1	#	What is this?
1	#	I thought you were gonna watch a video.
1	#	Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.
1	#	Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.
1	#	No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...
1	#	So, the free love buffet is over?
1	#	Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.
1	#	What's going on?
1	#	Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.
1	#	No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
1	#	All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)
1	#	Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.
1	#	It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.
1	#	What's wrong with yours?
1	#	All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!
1	#	Is this really necessary?
1	#	What if I can't keep up?
1	#	What's going on?
1	#	Oh my God, the blood!
1	#	Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.
1	#	What's the kid doing here?
1	#	Oh, that's a drag...
1	#	You put blood in the car?!
1	#	Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.
1	#	Then who?
1	#	Aaaaahhh...!!!
1	#	(on the phone) Yeah. Yeah. All right. Uh-huh.
1	#	(hanging up the phone) Oh! There's my Chinese food, I gotta run. All you.
1	#	I did a show for a car dealership and they're getting me a new SAAB.
1	#	No, the engine clotted. You know who set this whole thing up for me? Frank Merman.
1	#	Why? He's harmless.
1	#	He was not the summer you. Besides, you had a summer me. Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you into Last Tango in Paris.
1	#	So you never saw Last Tango in Paris?
1	#	Too bad. It was erotic.
1	#	Pottery Barn'?
1	#	Why don't you just throw 'em out?
1	#	(taking a catalog) Can I have one? I need one of those old-looking phones. So you wanna grab a bite?
1	#	So call now.
1	#	That's him.
1	#	What do you think? They gave me a new car for thirty minutes of 'So, who's from out of town?'
1	#	So, maybe they had Chinese food?
1	#	Well, there's one way to check. Where there's Chinese food, there's leftovers.
1	#	It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?
1	#	So, this is beautiful. You, and Puddy, and this new guy, in a big pot of love stew.
1	#	Stop the mail?
1	#	Hey, Frankie! So, where's the car?
1	#	Inside the van?
1	#	We were ten.
1	#	I don't want a van.
1	#	You don't understand. This is Fragile Frankie Merman. When we were in camp, if you upset him, he'd run out to the woods, dig a hole, and sit in it.
1	#	Always helpful.
1	#	Aye, aye.
1	#	Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.
1	#	Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?
1	#	No, no, no. Just hypothetically.
1	#	No! No, you don't! No woods. I love the van. I'm a van guy.
1	#	Where'd you get the bricks?
1	#	So you want to take a ride with me out to Jersey? I'm gonna try to sell the van to a lot.
1	#	I don't think I want to meet the people that are in the market for a used van.
1	#	OK.
1	#	I don't want to trade.
1	#	Hey, you know what? This is all your mail. They're puttin' it in my box now.
1	#	But this is what you've always wanted.
1	#	Aw, that's kind of sweet.
1	#	Oh, no. George, please. What are you going to do?
1	#	Mother of God.
1	#	That guy Elaine's dating seems really familiar to me. I think he may have been a comedian I worked with one time. Wait a minute, what is this?
1	#	That is the guy!
1	#	No, she thinks she's in love with him. But she's just remembering this old commercial.
1	#	I know. They're not even related.
1	#	Hey, have fun at the... family reunion. (George exits) So, what do you know about this Jack fellow?
1	#	Yeah, nobody beats him. What kind of work does he do?
1	#	(turning on the commercial) Right, quiet dignity. As opposed to, say, this?
1	#	Oh, yes.
1	#	(answering the phone) Hello? Yeah, the van is still for sale. Sure, come on buy.
1	#	You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
1	#	Two.
1	#	Look, do you really want to buy this thing, or what?
1	#	All right, just get out of here.
1	#	OK, fine. 'What do I have to do to put you in this van today?'
1	#	You put that in!
1	#	You want to trade me an undershirt?
1	#	That's disgusting.
1	#	She's into it?
1	#	So have your parents found out about it?
1	#	Brave new world, alright.
1	#	Hey, how's the anti-mail campaign going?
1	#	It's Sunday.
1	#	Hey, I want my van keys back.
1	#	Are you insane? Give 'em to me.
1	#	Oh, no, not Frankie.
1	#	Oh, no, the woods! The hole!
1	#	Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie, is that you?
1	#	Have a nice night.
1	#	(finding Frankie, in his hole) Frankie... come on out of there.
1	#	But I'm keeping it. As much as I hate the idea of being a van guy, it's much better than hanging out here with the nocturnal dirt people.
1	#	Yeah, let's just get out of here.
1	#	Hey, George!
1	#	What? George Costanza, Frankie Merman.
1	#	You must be George's cousin.
1	#	All right.
1	#	Don't go a-knockin'.
1	#	Oh, yeah.
1	#	I just think if you borrow my blender you should return it.
1	#	Yeah, ya know Cain slew Able.
1	#	Oh, no.
1	#	Well I think Able worked hard all summer harvesting his crops, while Cain just played in the field. Then when Winter came, Able had all the nuts; Cain had no nuts, so he killed him.
1	#	Ya broke my blender, didnt ya?
1	#	I knew it.
1	#	Why were you making gravel?
1	#	Of course. It's garbage.
1	#	Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.
1	#	Come on, Kramer, get out of there.
1	#	(moans) Ohhh (walks away)
1	#	And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
1	#	Wow! (Jerry spots all the classic toys)
1	#	Where did you get all these?
1	#	Super bowl! Hey, an original G.I. Joe. (picks up both items) With a full frogman suit.
1	#	I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
1	#	I just want a, touch em a little.
1	#	You ran over some pigeons? How many?
1	#	Course we have a deal. They get out of the way of our cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.
1	#	So Miranda's cooled on ya?
1	#	Yeah, me neither.
1	#	Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection and she won't let me near it!
1	#	Here comes one.
1	#	So he just sidles up?
1	#	Maybe you just didn't see him.
1	#	Hakuna Matata?
1	#	That doesn't make it right.
1	#	See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing as the cup of soup...
1	#	Oh my God!
1	#	How did you get this in here?
1	#	So where you gonna sleep?
1	#	I'm gonna get that. (walks across the set towards the blue curtain)
1	#	So three dates and she still won't let me play with her toys.
1	#	Yeah, that was me.
1	#	An Army Pete.
1	#	He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and then split.
1	#	You, sidle? Y-You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!
1	#	What happened?
1	#	So they're like everyone else.
1	#	(sound of gunfire) Pkew, pkew, pkew, pkew, Pkeeew!
1	#	I'm sorry. Got any booze? What's say you and I get ripped!
1	#	All right.
1	#	Ohh, will not cause drowsiness"
1	#	Uhn-uh-uhn - Uhn-uh-uhn - - veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer, veeer A-Ha ha! Mission accomplished! Back to base, Joe. (singing) dee, de-de, de-de-de-de-de (Makes G.I. Joe swim off, legs kicking)
1	#	What's he here for?
1	#	Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has this amazing toy collection and last night I finally got to play with them.
1	#	Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her the wrong kind of medicine and I, guess she passed out!
1	#	She's even got that old Mattel football game that we love!
1	#	Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!
1	#	So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey and a giant box of wine, I thought ... What a coincidence. We're just about to eat.
1	#	... I think. Have some more wine. (Jerry pours his whole glass of wine into her glass.)
1	#	Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.
1	#	More heavy gravy?
1	#	Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
1	#	What about my "questionable material"?
1	#	Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom" is coming to your apartment?
1	#	Tic-Tacs work?
1	#	What? It's a victimless crime.
1	#	Okay, one victim.
1	#	You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.
1	#	You're like eight years old.
1	#	It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
1	#	No, not a thing.
1	#	What, What is this? What is she doing here?
1	#	Well, what kind of woman drinks an entire box of wine?
1	#	So the whole set was destroyed?
1	#	So the squirrel's gonna make it?
1	#	On the couch? So you're...
1	#	Morning.
1	#	But why?
1	#	You don't think she's just talking to me?
1	#	You shut up.
1	#	We'll come to work with you.
1	#	And shopping.
1	#	The boom box incident?
1	#	Seems reasonable.
1	#	Even more reasonable.
1	#	And that guy is your new boss?
1	#	Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.
1	#	Neither have I.
1	#	Where did you get this thing?
1	#	Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.
1	#	Mmhu.
1	#	What's with you?
1	#	Your whole building smells like potatoes.
1	#	I think we might have one left in the stock room.
1	#	Well, I have this neighbor...
1	#	Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?
1	#	Cause I hit a whopper last week!
1	#	He took out Kruger?
1	#	Where did you get that butcher's coat?
1	#	Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.
1	#	Dermatology?
1	#	Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe on it.
1	#	Oh, what's the point?
1	#	Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.
1	#	Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!
1	#	You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.
1	#	Flowers?
1	#	So, you've done this?
1	#	Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?
1	#	It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!
1	#	You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!
1	#	She saved your life?
1	#	Skin cancer! Damn.
1	#	He looks like a Peanuts character.
1	#	You can do that.
1	#	You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.
1	#	I understand.
1	#	True. You mean, for you?
1	#	What about your sea sickness?
1	#	I don't know if they have land guys.
1	#	Drawer.
1	#	What are they for?
1	#	Come again?
1	#	Eh, it went okay.
1	#	Yeah, I started out real classy...
1	#	But then I found out about the skin cancer.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.
1	#	Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!
1	#	Must I?
1	#	How does that reflect me?
1	#	So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...
1	#	Was it pimple popper MD?
1	#	Still got it.
1	#	What the hell is this?
1	#	No.
1	#	Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office and apologized...
1	#	Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...
1	#	What, she gave me hives?
1	#	She did kind of touch my face.
1	#	It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.
1	#	I don't know, this? (Shows his neck to Sara.)
1	#	Where do you suppose that could've come from?
1	#	Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science do you practice?
1	#	I want the antidote, pimple popper!
1	#	Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!
1	#	So, Kramer pulled it off?
1	#	Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks like I had a beard of bees!
1	#	I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist in this town? (Kramer comes in) A real dermatologist.
1	#	Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.
1	#	Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, a common ingredient in metal cleaners.
1	#	What are you doing?
1	#	That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's from Dr. Van Nostrand!
1	#	Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you (throws the bottle to Kramer.)
1	#	I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.
1	#	Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really bad.
1	#	Aloe. So where's that lock smith?
1	#	(Sarcastic) Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.
1	#	(To George) I said I was sorry.
1	#	(Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
1	#	I don't want to talk about it!
1	#	Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
1	#	I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!
1	#	(Pleading) George, I'm sorry.
1	#	(Confused) I don't know what that means.
1	#	That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Oh, you were pretty loaded.
1	#	Oh. Hello, Tetanus.
1	#	(As George sits down) George, we need to talk.
1	#	Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.
1	#	(Pleading) I'm really sorry.
1	#	(Confused) Where'd you get that one?
1	#	That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.
1	#	How did he find out?
1	#	You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?
1	#	(Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.
1	#	Pinter?
1	#	(Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?
1	#	Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. Alright, it's time to go. Come on.. Up.
1	#	(Carrying her out, piggy-back style) No, what?
1	#	Yes, Jugdish.
1	#	(Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea. Well, good night.
1	#	Bless you.
1	#	(Joking around) I think it's the stench of death.
1	#	(Giddy) This is gonna be great!
1	#	Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strange the whole flight?
1	#	(Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look what they had on the plane. Schnapps.
1	#	Coach to India - The only way to go.
1	#	You all right?
1	#	(Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth grade?
1	#	You just asked me two minutes ago.
1	#	Ah, Im not wearing a watch.
1	#	Yeah. Howd ya do that?
1	#	(Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this hell-hole because of George.
1	#	(Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman, don't ya?
1	#	What are you talking about.
1	#	By flying half way around the world?
1	#	Especially when you got a layover in Sarajevo. (Bosnia Herzegovina)
1	#	(Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey - Hey Kramer, what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat something? Come on in!
1	#	H-Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.
1	#	Great, I love Newman! (Eagerly following Kramer)
1	#	Uh-huh.
1	#	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm..
1	#	Uh-huh..
1	#	Sure.
1	#	Uh-huh.
1	#	Uh-huh.
1	#	(To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice. Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee. Maybe you should go get some coffee.
1	#	Sure.
1	#	Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.
1	#	Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.
1	#	No good. Too many people know the combination.
1	#	Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!
1	#	And milk.
1	#	(From outside the apartment) Hello?
1	#	Ah, just remember when you see him tomorrow night to tell him that the waiter liked him.
1	#	Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging out with you.
1	#	I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..
1	#	Probably the reason..
1	#	Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR wants you to drop dead.
1	#	Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)
1	#	(Also guessing) Crook eye?
1	#	Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday.
1	#	Everyday is my birthday. (Sarcastically joking off what George said)
1	#	(Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding gown will give her some support.
1	#	So you think it's a non-vite?
1	#	Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.
1	#	He wants me to set him up with this girl, Nina Stengal.
1	#	I was kidding when I said that!
1	#	(On the phone) Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.
1	#	(To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy, huh?
1	#	Get outta here.
1	#	Hmm..
1	#	Sure.
1	#	Are you?
1	#	We were too compatible Our conversations were so engrossing.
1	#	If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.
1	#	Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.
1	#	Why?
1	#	So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?
1	#	Oh, I'm sure it's fine.
1	#	Almost. (Notices his shoes) Hey, new Timberlands?
1	#	Really?
1	#	Nina?
1	#	It's been years!
1	#	(Introducing the two) George, this is Nina.
1	#	(Mesmerized) What are you, a scientist?!
1	#	Ah.
1	#	Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the hell is e-mail?
1	#	Pretty good. I think she might be the one.
1	#	What are you bringing snowballs in here for?
1	#	Hi, Elaine.
1	#	Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.
1	#	Oh.
1	#	No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?
1	#	Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)
1	#	(tapping the spatula while waiting for waffles to be done) Any second now. Light is on! Melissa, waffles are ready.
1	#	(looking at her) How about that.
1	#	She didn't even want a napkin.
1	#	Oh, it's a scene.
1	#	I don't really have enough room.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Back together?
1	#	Ah...
1	#	Why now?
1	#	Still with the neck hole?
1	#	A cashmere sweater.
1	#	No, I think the head does most of the stretching.
1	#	That was an hour ago. What were you doing in there?
1	#	Ten minutes.
1	#	So?
1	#	(seeing Kramer struggle to open a soda, spilling it all over) I think the damage is probably already done. (interrupting Kramer's inadequate attempt to clean up the soda) All right! I'll get that. Well, maybe she just practices good hygiene.
1	#	Mmm.
1	#	(playing Scrabble with his naked girlfriend) Zephyr? That is not a word.
1	#	No, I do not challenge.
1	#	I'd accuse you of cheating, but I don't know where you'd hide the tiles.
1	#	Sure.
1	#	Coughing... naked... It's a turn-off, man.
1	#	When you cough, there are thousands of unseen muscles that suddenly spring into action. It's like watching that fat guy catch a cannonball in his stomach in slow motion.
1	#	But the thing you don't realize is that there's good naked and bad naked. Naked hair brushing, good; naked crouching, bad. Hey, there's Hanke.
1	#	Thank you. I did notice, and I appreciate you rectifying it.
1	#	(pointing to Kramer's hair) You got some suds over here.
1	#	Oh, come on!
1	#	You promise you'll never come in here again?
1	#	(standing in the bathtub) Now my sense of it is that you're probably wasting time working piecemeal, first cleaning one area, then another.
1	#	But, when you have a faucet instead of a tongue, you want to use gravity.
1	#	No, I told you, it's just a dry run.
1	#	That's Step Ten?
1	#	You're not gettin' any skin, Kramer.
1	#	What happened to you?
1	#	(giving him a steak from the fridge) Here ya go.
1	#	What?
1	#	(closing the door on him) Oh!
1	#	Oh. That wasn't really necessary. I don't ride it. It's just for show.
1	#	Please don't crouch.
1	#	Oh, that's bad. Especially that area.
1	#	Uhh...
1	#	Look, please stop! Let me help you with that!
1	#	(leaving the room) I can't. I can't look anymore. I-I-I've seen too much.
1	#	Well, technically he did apologize.
1	#	So now you want an apology for the apology, plus the original apology?
1	#	Well, I hit the wall yesterday with Lady Godiva. She did a full body flex on a pickle jar.
1	#	Where am I gonna get a fat guy and a cannonball?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	(answering the ringing phone) Hello?
1	#	World War I plane?
1	#	When are ya gettin' out?
1	#	(naked, carrying a belt sander) I found a rough spot on the kitchen floor, I thought I'd polish it up with this belt sander I have here.
1	#	I thought naked is good.
1	#	He took you to Rage-aholics? Why?
1	#	You've got a little rage.
1	#	By the way, my bad naked demo didn't quite work.
1	#	(seeing Elaine enter Monk's) Oh, great. Elaine. What is wrong with my body?
1	#	That's it?
1	#	Well, I was walking around naked in front of Melissa the other day--
1	#	So you don't think it's attractive?
1	#	So I'm glad we had a talk and worked this out. Don't you feel this is better?
1	#	Yes, clothes. This is normal.
1	#	Oh... yeah. What? I'm sorry.
1	#	Oh, maybe a haircut, and, I don't know, maybe a...
1	#	We couldn't carry on a conversation. I kept trying to picture her naked, she kept trying to not picture me naked.
1	#	So what are you up to?
1	#	Insert a knife into the center and twist. Then, to make it bloom, soak it in water for thirty to forty minutes.
1	#	Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.
1	#	Hey, Tim. Great party.
1	#	You have a standard fake?
1	#	(Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat.
1	#	Hi, I'm Jerry.
1	#	Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?
1	#	Didn't you call in sick yesterday?
1	#	(Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your mail here?
1	#	See? You give, and you get.
1	#	Oh, that's nice.
1	#	To a children's charity!
1	#	Hey.
1	#	"Atomic Sub"? Why are you eating there?
1	#	What does that mean?
1	#	When George was growing up..
1	#	His father..
1	#	Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday.
1	#	And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole?
1	#	And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying?
1	#	So?
1	#	No, you walk out.
1	#	No, you wait for the movie!
1	#	You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.
1	#	So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it?
1	#	What strike?
1	#	You?
1	#	Bagels?
1	#	Why didn't you ever mention this?
1	#	Hey, Tim.
1	#	Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.
1	#	Gwen?
1	#	(Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?
1	#	Have you come across this?
1	#	(Relating) Like the Batman villain?
1	#	So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up The good, the bad, or the ugly.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	(Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that?
1	#	(Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."
1	#	It has a certain understated stupidity.
1	#	..Yeah.
1	#	How was your first day?
1	#	Your hands were in the dough?
1	#	Happy Festivus!
1	#	When George was growing up..
1	#	His father..
1	#	You're still trying to gget that free sub?
1	#	Is there a captain's hat involved in this?
1	#	Boy, am I glad to see you.
1	#	You never know.
1	#	So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?
1	#	(Shocked) You're telling me.
1	#	Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there.
1	#	I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress?
1	#	Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.
1	#	That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.
1	#	Oh, that's classy.
1	#	I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.
1	#	Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive) Now this is a good looking booth.
1	#	Why? It's our place.
1	#	Oh.. I know who's cooking today!
1	#	Hey, Georgie!
1	#	I'll be here.
1	#	She didn't touch it.
1	#	20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
1	#	Excuse me?
1	#	You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars.
1	#	You're going to start your own charity?
1	#	They nailed you on the 20 G's?
1	#	Gwen! How'd you know I was here?
1	#	Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting on the porch.
1	#	I thought you were on strike?
1	#	Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..
1	#	I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.
1	#	What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.
1	#	Well, what do you think the big holdup is?
1	#	Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?
1	#	It's like we're living in the '50s here.
1	#	(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)
1	#	(Gestures to his forehead) Youre getting that vein again.
1	#	(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.
1	#	I guess he graduated.
1	#	(To Kramer) Thank you.
1	#	All right. Calm down.
1	#	(To Kramer) All right, were goin in.
1	#	(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, were just waiting for David Puddy.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Ah. Whered you go?
1	#	So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.
1	#	(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.
1	#	So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more "grease monkey".
1	#	Oh. Sorry, I didnt know..
1	#	I saw one once that could do sign language.
1	#	Yeah, Koko.
1	#	No. We both just saw the same monkey.
1	#	(Getting a dollar out) Wheres your money?
1	#	Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?
1	#	No.
1	#	No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.
1	#	Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now.
1	#	What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.
1	#	(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.
1	#	(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.
1	#	Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?
1	#	How much was under there?
1	#	(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)
1	#	Hey, can I have my dollar back?
1	#	(Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! Wh-where are you?
1	#	Did you two break up?
1	#	"Rust-proofing"?
1	#	"Finders fee"? It was on the lot!
1	#	Keys?!
1	#	Hey, George!
1	#	No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now!
1	#	(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.
1	#	George! Can we focus on the car, here?
1	#	Yellow? I wanted black.
1	#	(Pleading) George, would you help me, please?
1	#	Sing it, sister!
1	#	(Exasperated) Oh, God
1	#	(To Puddy) Ill be right back.
1	#	Hey, George!
1	#	(Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!
1	#	(Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine!
1	#	You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.
1	#	Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands of dollars!
1	#	Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.
1	#	Fine.
1	#	No. No lunch.
1	#	All right! Lunch!
1	#	Bye. (Hangs up)
1	#	(Frustrated, he reacts) Everybodys ripping me off!
1	#	No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.
1	#	Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?
1	#	Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.
1	#	(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?
1	#	All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.
1	#	So, youre back together?
1	#	All right, all right. All right, thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats a rip-off, isnt it, David?
1	#	So, Im gettin the insiders deal?
1	#	And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, "Dont go there." - Someones gotta take a stand!
1	#	And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?
1	#	I think theres a mental hospital near here.
1	#	So, Puddy wear's a man fur?
1	#	And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.
1	#	You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.
1	#	Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin' him.
1	#	Cheapness is not a sense.
1	#	I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the music. I turned that mother out.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?
1	#	But then anyone can just look in and see you.
1	#	Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the way.
1	#	What?
1	#	That's a five.
1	#	Except the store's in Delaware.
1	#	Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.
1	#	Why?
1	#	But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.
1	#	Irish money?
1	#	Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.
1	#	George, I am loving this no wallet thing.
1	#	You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think I'm onto something.
1	#	Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.
1	#	Music?
1	#	But I could do that and the music.
1	#	I was ready to get jiggy with it.
1	#	Hey, Elaine.
1	#	So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?
1	#	So, we're givin' him nothing?
1	#	Did you at least get him a card?
1	#	Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?
1	#	(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.
1	#	Because you threw it out.
1	#	But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
1	#	But that's you.
1	#	Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.
1	#	What was that?
1	#	All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
1	#	No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?
1	#	Compact, lipstick, all this?
1	#	What are you, a medieval dungeon master?
1	#	Ow! Sharp key.
1	#	You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, and I want to keep that weight off.
1	#	Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
1	#	I'm not carrying a purse.
1	#	Oh.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?
1	#	What?
1	#	No.
1	#	Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split it three ways.
1	#	What is that noise?
1	#	You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.
1	#	What was that pop sound?
1	#	It's European.
1	#	Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?
1	#	What, he doesn't like my taste in music?
1	#	You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
1	#	I have to do what?
1	#	I'm not wearing the fur.
1	#	Is that right?
1	#	Newman, too?
1	#	That's my walkman!
1	#	All right.
1	#	George, did you get that chair yet?
1	#	You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
1	#	Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' a gift from me.
1	#	No, you don't have to buy anything.
1	#	I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
1	#	Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
1	#	Your good friend is morbidly obese.
1	#	It's not a purse. It's European!
1	#	All right.
1	#	How do I look?
1	#	Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.
1	#	It sure is.
1	#	That's true.
1	#	Oh, thanks.
1	#	Maybe this isn't my coat.
1	#	No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.
1	#	Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!
1	#	The...black, leather...thing with a strap.
1	#	Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!
1	#	So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?
1	#	He should have had a reverse peephole.
1	#	Hello? Hello?
1	#	So your saying UNICEF is a scam?
1	#	Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.
1	#	No, It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to New York a few years ago . she's trying to become an actress.
1	#	Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some bad play in tiny room without ventilation. It's really depressing.
1	#	She should just give up.
1	#	Heeyyy!...
1	#	Kramer!!!
1	#	So......Susan's dead.....
1	#	Why'd you have to say anything to her?
1	#	Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
1	#	What did you wanna be?
1	#	I don't either.
1	#	It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
1	#	You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?
1	#	She does not.
1	#	Hey! Kramer.
1	#	What! You're the one who ruined her life.
1	#	Well, I got to talk her out of this.
1	#	She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it to be because of me. It should be the traditional route; years of rejections and failures till she's spit out the bottom of the porn industry.
1	#	Yeah...
1	#	George's girlfriend, Elaine thinks she looks like me but I think it's as you would say,kookie talk.
1	#	What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a man and George doesn't want to hear his girlfriend looks like me and frankly neither do I
1	#	You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.
1	#	Yeah! Because of you.
1	#	Sally, you can't quit the business. This is all because of me.
1	#	You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink? When I'm on stage that's all I hear; You stink, You suck. We like magic.
1	#	Of course, I stink, you stink. It's show bizz. everybody stinks..
1	#	All right, I think we've covered my act. Now you get out there and stink it up with everybody else.
1	#	NOW!!!!.... (she leaves in a hurry)
1	#	Oh! I think we're at the bottom.
1	#	Yeah. What does that mean?
1	#	Elaine huh?.. She's completely..
1	#	No....
1	#	It's ludicrous..
1	#	For either one of us..
1	#	So...
1	#	I'm not gay.
1	#	Come on in here.
1	#	What's happening? What, you doing, come and talk to us.
1	#	Lets talk about that.
1	#	Yeah right.
1	#	Kramer you're never gonna be able to completely stop talking.
1	#	Well what does this mean?
1	#	Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
1	#	Oh! you just startin' now?
1	#	Sally, I can't believe you're already doing a One-woman show?
1	#	Ah! There you are.(Kramer motions silence)
1	#	Aw.. right, code of silence.. how's that going?....Ha!!...
1	#	(to Kramer) Oh! Shut up!!!
1	#	Good luck, It's sold out for the next three weeks.
1	#	The New Yorker?
1	#	Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew
1	#	Nodding off...
1	#	Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw.
1	#	What, your sad little horsies, the house with the little curl of smoke, the sunflower with the smiley face. the transparent cube... (as she leaves)
1	#	Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
1	#	No,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld is the devil.
1	#	I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.
1	#	You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
1	#	What a surprise.
1	#	There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
1	#	Get Out of my House!!.
1	#	I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before I'd go out.
1	#	some mouthwash, a hat, something.
1	#	(glances at it) Pretty good.
1	#	It's a pig at a complain department.
1	#	I get it.
1	#	How 'bout if it was something like " I can't find my receipt my place's a stye.
1	#	I'm a comedian.
1	#	Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
1	#	oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
1	#	Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally, yeah this is Jerry,I just wanted to leave you a message that I caught your little piece on TV and..
1	#	....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I am and would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
1	#	(from the back of the club, leaving) That's it I'm calling in the big guns.
1	#	How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable special . I 've never gotten a cable special.....well that's it I'm not giving her any more material. We are incommunicado. (to the silent Kramer on the couch beside him) ...Exactly.
1	#	You ripped off a Ziggy?
1	#	I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The New Yorker is stealing my ideas." ha ha ha See that's funny.....'cause it's real.
1	#	Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this, now she's got nothing.
1	#	That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
1	#	Elaine, have you been talking to her?
1	#	(to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking??
1	#	You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how short?
1	#	You mean like.. (points to his hair)
1	#	So she..
1	#	And you don't...
1	#	So...
1	#	Hmmmm...
1	#	No, no......(long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey uh.. you want to see a movie?
1	#	I think that's for the best.
1	#	She said no?
1	#	What did you do?
1	#	George, both parties don't have to consent to a break-up. It's not like you're launching missiles from a submarine and you both have to turn your keys. Obviously, you didn't make a convincing case. Let me hear your arguments.
1	#	That's good.
1	#	Solid.
1	#	Always popular.
1	#	You have an airtight case!
1	#	I'm afraid we're out of time.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Check these out. These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks that he actually wore in the movie "Cinderfella". I got 'em at an auction.
1	#	No, Jerry Lewis is gonna be at this Friar's Club roast I'm goin' to next week. Now I have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
1	#	Oh, that'll intrigue him.
1	#	George Peppard has been dead for years.
1	#	What about Puddy?
1	#	(unimpressed) So, what's this guy about?
1	#	Or he's a crime fighter safeguarding his secret identity! Elaine, you could be dating the Green Lantern!
1	#	Green suit, power ring.
1	#	So you bought a cooler?
1	#	(doubtful) You were in the Army?
1	#	No, go ahead.
1	#	Oh, come on!
1	#	(walking towards door with Elaine) How long did you last? (opens door)
1	#	Kramer?!
1	#	So, you would date a married guy? That's so hacky.
1	#	THIS is your hiding place?! (Elaine laughs)
1	#	Elaine, what are you doin' down there?
1	#	Oh, I guess it's broken!
1	#	It's liable to bounce and go into a sewer.
1	#	You'll chicken out at the last second.
1	#	(annoyed) All right. (after a pause) Hey, you know what's weird?
1	#	I used to be able to have a huge meal and go right to sleep. But I can't anymore.
1	#	All right.
1	#	Here! I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
1	#	Hey...
1	#	(waving the key) You jammed your key in here? You shorted out my intercom!
1	#	I'm gonna go let Elaine in. (Kramer reaches out to stop him leaving)
1	#	(in the hallway, hearing the door lock behind him, turns back) Kramer!
1	#	Oh, hey. You got in.
1	#	(taking the menus) Oh, thanks.
1	#	So, he's definitely married, huh?
1	#	Boy, I would love to have been there when you told him off.
1	#	Oh, come on!
1	#	(out of window) George, the buzzer's broken! I'll come down!
1	#	(putting on his coat to go downstairs, he finds the key in his coat pocket) I believe this belongs to you.
1	#	(opens the door for George) Where did you get that?
1	#	(barring the way) I'm sorry. I-I don't know you.
1	#	There's been some robberies in the building. I-I can't let you in.
1	#	(shakes his head) I'm very sorry. (closing the door on Phil. Jerry smiles and shrugs apologetically as Phil stares at them through the glass)
1	#	Great, you're lonely and miserable again. (presses button to call elevator)
1	#	Is that guy still there? (They are side-on to Phil who is in the background, still pressed against the glass, aghast)
1	#	Don't look at him. (Phil starts to knock on the door)
1	#	We don't hear that. (They enter the elevator)
1	#	Nooo, I don't. (the elevator doors shut)
1	#	So you do live here.
1	#	You live on this floor?
1	#	(arriving at apartment, sees Phil start to open his apartment door, only one door down from Kramer's) So you live right... there.
1	#	So I guess I'll s--
1	#	Is he wretchedly poor? Does he wear one of those barrels with the straps?
1	#	So, when are you giving Boxcar Willie his walking papers?
1	#	Well, let's think. Have you ever dealt with the poor in any other situation?
1	#	Good. How did you handle that?
1	#	Same situation. Pay him off, and you're clean.
1	#	Hey, where have you been?
1	#	We found out his super power was lack of money.
1	#	He's invulnerable to creditors.
1	#	He's the Got-no-Green Lantern.
1	#	Sure, just tell Maura you're having an affair.
1	#	(fidgets like he has no room with George next to him)... Could you move over there?!
1	#	Really? How come you never pursued her before?
1	#	(to Elaine, still joking) He can wipe out his checking account in a single bounce!
1	#	There's a giant parrot in the hallway.
1	#	Who?
1	#	What'd ya tell him that for?
1	#	Really? What's it like? Is it nicer than mine? Where does he have the couch?
1	#	He let you?
1	#	Hi. Is Phil here?
1	#	Phil... hi. I-I know we got off to kind of a bad start. But your bird, which is lovely... by the way, made a mess on my door.
1	#	I thought maybe you'd clean it up, or your maid, there.
1	#	(nodding awkwardly for a moment) All right, I think we're done here. (Jerry leaves and Phil shuts the door darkly)
1	#	(in a tuxedo) So, you're in a relationship with a woman you don't like, and you're having an affair with a woman that won't have sex with you.
1	#	I cannot find my Jerry Lewis cufflinks. Without 'em, I have no in!
1	#	Where are you goin'? Help me look!
1	#	Which is with who?
1	#	I can't go until I find my cufflinks.
1	#	You're a lifesaver. Would you get them, please?
1	#	That strange Portuguese guy that lives next-door to the incinerator?
1	#	Oh, Phil... Mrs. Phil. I'm so sorry.
1	#	But I, I didn't, I--
1	#	Kramer, they think I killed Fredo! (Kramer gestures sympathetically) And who buries a bird?
1	#	Just get the key and let's get out of here.
1	#	Kramer!? (grabbing Kramer's arm roughly, pulling him back as he's about to knock)
1	#	You killed Fredo!
1	#	Kramer, I need those cufflinks, but now they're in the box, and the key is in the bird... What are we gonna do?
1	#	(frowning in realization) Oh, no!
1	#	Kramer, I can't believe we're grave robbers.
1	#	(seeing Fredo's tombstone) Oh, my God. Here he is. I don't want to dig him up! (hands the shovel to Kramer)
1	#	(grimaces and takes the shovel back) I'll dig.
1	#	(hitting metal with the first strike of the shovel) Well, that was easy.
1	#	(with a wild expression) Hey, Kramer! I dug Fredo up, now let's cut him open!
1	#	(after a very awkward pause, cheerily) Hey, neighbor.
1	#	(still in tuxedo, tie undone) Ah, I'll just take the fire escape to get in and out of the building.
1	#	You mean it was open? We desecrated a pet cemetery for nothing?
1	#	It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.
1	#	Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.
1	#	Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.
1	#	Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?
1	#	Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.
1	#	Still no Puddy?
1	#	What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?
1	#	Darryl. He's black, isn't he?
1	#	Isn't he, Elaine?
1	#	What's his last name?
1	#	I think he's black.
1	#	Why not?
1	#	If he's black.
1	#	Does it matter?
1	#	Oh, so you need to know?
1	#	(getting out his wallet) Uh, one second.
1	#	House in the Hamptons?
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Wow. What are we celebrating?
1	#	With the little legs?
1	#	How much are they payin' you?
1	#	That's funny because I haven't seen you working for a while. A long while.
1	#	From what?
1	#	(seeing that Kramer has a new watch) What's that?
1	#	It's 530 in the morning!
1	#	(handing his dad a gift) Well, as long as I'm up. Dad, I got you a birthday present. Here. Happy Birthday.
1	#	What does that mean?
1	#	Radar detector? I've never seen you go over twenty miles an hour. You're like the Grand Marshall of the Rose Bowl Parade. It's a Wizard organizer.
1	#	Nah, I got it from a guy on the street. It was, like, fifty bucks.
1	#	Could be.
1	#	And you can do everything with it. You can get e-mail, fax, there's a calculator.
1	#	Yeah, I guess. But the really cool thing is the daily planner.
1	#	Kramer, what are you doing here?
1	#	Kramer, you can't live down here. This is where people come to die.
1	#	(getting looks from his parents) Not you. Older people.
1	#	If you feed him, he'll never leave.
1	#	I can't believe this.
1	#	Dad, it's got lots of other functions.
1	#	(looking at the Wizard) Well, your tip is four dollars and thirty-six point six six six six cents.
1	#	Oh, right. You can't run for condo president because you were impeached at the other condo.
1	#	What press?
1	#	She's fifty.
1	#	(in his parent's condo, on the phone with Elaine) So did you figure out Darryl's... you know.
1	#	(as Kramer walks by) You're a master of race relations.
1	#	Yeah, it's all my father's doing.
1	#	He wants to install Kramer in a puppet regime and then wield power from behind the scenes. Preferably from the sauna in the clubhouse.
1	#	Common sense and a guy in a wheelchair.
1	#	(overhearing the other two Elaine, Elaine--
1	#	(overhearing the other two) Oh, no.
1	#	George, listen to me. I have a very important job for you. I want you to come by twice a day and flush the toilet so the gaskets don't dry out and leak.
1	#	This is far more important. You must exercise the gaskets, George.
1	#	(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.
1	#	You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
1	#	Kramer, these people work and wait their whole lives to move down here, sit in the heat, pretend it's not hot, and enforce these rules.
1	#	Wizards!
1	#	Kramer...
1	#	Kramer, I can't get that many Wizards.
1	#	I didn't have a deal! They're two hundred dollars a pop. What do I do?
1	#	Down here?
1	#	Aw.
1	#	A Willard? Saccamano, Sr. screwed me!
1	#	Because a real Wizard's two hundred dollars.
1	#	No deal. Not hot.
1	#	Dad, I'm sorry.
1	#	It does other things!
1	#	And then?
1	#	Showmanship, George. When you hit that high note, you say goodnight and walk off.
1	#	That's the way they do it in Vegas.
1	#	I hear things.
1	#	It's a used car, he probably never changed the presets.
1	#	Plus he probably doesn't even know how to program the buttons.
1	#	So you prefer dumb and lazy to religious?
1	#	No, no, the old switcheroo is you poison your drink then you switch it with the other person's.
1	#	Yeah, Elaine's gonna do the same thing to Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.
1	#	Oh, she's picking me up in a few minutes.
1	#	I dunno. Since the last one. Oh, here she is. You wanna meet her?
1	#	Hey Mickey. Check the pepper shaker.
1	#	What's with the fake sneezing?
1	#	Do medical schools actually do this?
1	#	I think the phone is ringing.
1	#	Would you hold it a second?! Thank you, will you get out of here with that stuff?
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Elaine?
1	#	George??
1	#	Oh, I knew it was you, I was joking. I'm a comedian.
1	#	Ipecac? Kramer, I really think you guys are going too far with this.
1	#	Did he overdose?
1	#	What did you do the rest of the day?
1	#	And a bit of a tramp if you ask me.
1	#	No. So you're disappointed he's a spiritual person?
1	#	I hear things. Hey, so Sophie gave me the "It's me" on the phone today.
1	#	I thought so.
1	#	No, no. He's pretending he's got gonorrhea so med students can diagnose it.
1	#	Showmanship, George is trying to get out on a high note.
1	#	Yes! Step into that spotlight and belt that gonorrhea out to the back row.
1	#	One message. Hope it's not from you.
1	#	Sophie.
1	#	Yep.
1	#	I think that's a "what's good for the goose is good for the gander".
1	#	(picking up the phone and dialing) It's a goose that's had the old switcheroo pulled on it. Hi Sophie, it's me.
1	#	(to George) She thinks it's someone named Raef.
1	#	(into the phone, with a disguised voice) So, what's going on?
1	#	So, uh, how are things with Jerry?
1	#	Right, right, the tractor story.
1	#	I sound funny?
1	#	Yeah I better get to a doctor, bye. (Hangs up) That was close! What drives me to take chances like that?
1	#	She said there's some tractor story that she hasn't told me about.
1	#	Beep, beep, beep? What are you doing?
1	#	No one's stealing a tractor, it's a five-mile-an-hour getaway. We're dancing around the obvious, it's gotta be disfigurement.
1	#	No, she looks completely normal.
1	#	You think she's got toes for thumbs?
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Why do I seek your counsel?
1	#	That seems about right.
1	#	Hey, have you heard the one about the guy in hell with the coffee and the doughtnuts and--
1	#	What do you care? You don't believe in hell.
1	#	So it's more of a relationship problem than the final destination of your soul.
1	#	Maybe you can strike one up with the prince of darkness as you burn for all eternity.
1	#	They should update these pieces, nobody rides horses anymore. Maybe they should change it to a tractor.
1	#	Losing? You know, yesterday I lost control of my car, almost bought the farm.
1	#	Tractor!
1	#	Wait, don't go. Let's thumb wrestle.
1	#	A big long scar where her leg would dangle when she's riding a...?
1	#	I'm sure she's a little self-conscious and doesn't like to talk about it.
1	#	She doesn't have toe thumbs.
1	#	Alright. So how's the two-man operation at Kruger?
1	#	Never.
1	#	Sophie, it's me. I know about the tractor story and I'm fine with it.
1	#	(putting his finger to Sophie's lips, then to his own, then back to Sopie's) Shh. Shh. Shh. It's not important. What's important is I'm not gonna let a little thing like that ruin what could be a very long-term and meaningful relationship.
1	#	Hey, hey! I'm with someone.
1	#	You got gonorrhea from a tractor?? And you call *that* your tractor story??
1	#	(walking out) Alright, that's it for me. You've been great. Goodnight everybody.
1	#	First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin' anybody.
1	#	(Sarcastic) You better hurry.
1	#	(Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker vehicles.
1	#	She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the one she danced at last year?
1	#	(Pointing) Hey, there's Leo.
1	#	Uncle Leo.
1	#	Did I just see that?!
1	#	(Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend a lot of time in there.
1	#	(Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy) 'French Impressionist Paintings'?
1	#	(Cutting him off) Thank you very much.
1	#	I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at the bookstore.
1	#	Sleeping in the caragain?
1	#	(Remembering) Oh, right. The big party..
1	#	(Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic. Did you end up xeroxing anything?
1	#	(Confused) What's your position?
1	#	(Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of Skanko-Roman wrestling.
1	#	(Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and sandwiches?
1	#	(Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.
1	#	(Still skeptical) No, he doesn't.
1	#	Yes, it can.
1	#	So, who's gonna pull this thing?
1	#	(Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My, isn't this an awkward moment?
1	#	(Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard all day.
1	#	So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?
1	#	(Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?
1	#	(Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.
1	#	Because you were too busy stealing a book.
1	#	(Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.
1	#	Who, criminals?
1	#	You could get arrested.
1	#	(Pleading) Leo..
1	#	(Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.
1	#	(To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's having a little problem with shoplifting..
1	#	(Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..
1	#	51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?
1	#	(To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.
1	#	(Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip) Hello?
1	#	Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard to scare him straight.
1	#	(Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.
1	#	(Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo?
1	#	(Confused) What does that mean?
1	#	(Shocked at his parents) You're stealing too?!
1	#	Mom, you too?
1	#	Alright, I'll talk to you later.
1	#	(Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.
1	#	To the Idiotmobile!
1	#	So, even though you're not really going out with this guy, he's cheating on you?
1	#	(Butting in) Tina Turner?
1	#	Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?
1	#	(Stern on George) Not underpants.
1	#	(Getting up) Uncle Leo. Hello!
1	#	(Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know about your.. past.
1	#	(Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!
1	#	Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?
1	#	(Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that book.
1	#	That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the bathroom with him and-
1	#	I don't read in the bathroom.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	Uncle Leo?
1	#	Nightmares. You?
1	#	You're not feeding him, are you?
1	#	(Scared) Ah! Kramer!
1	#	Get out of here!
1	#	Will everybody please leave?!
1	#	I want everyone out!
1	#	(Bitter) Good night, Newman.
1	#	(To Elaine) So, the worst is over?
1	#	Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real ones.
1	#	(To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.
1	#	George? What are you doin' here?
1	#	(Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.
1	#	(Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?
1	#	Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
1	#	(Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All old people steal.
1	#	So it could be anyone?
1	#	That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm!
1	#	What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
1	#	Why aren't you there now?
1	#	You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee messiness.
1	#	Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me and George to Mario's Pizza?
1	#	They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
1	#	Where did you get this?
1	#	You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any of these people?
1	#	So they just gave you this?
1	#	How come I haven't read about this?
1	#	Son of dad?
1	#	We used to come in every day.
1	#	All right, make it the large sodas.
1	#	Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.
1	#	Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis Costanza. That's not you, is it?
1	#	I remember that night.
1	#	I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
1	#	I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--
1	#	Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--
1	#	Not as long.
1	#	Get going.
1	#	Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--
1	#	Actually, that's--
1	#	Right.
1	#	Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
1	#	Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.
1	#	Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
1	#	Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.
1	#	Oh, come on. There's a lot of people walking around the city that look like me.
1	#	Another friend?
1	#	Come on.
1	#	Hello?
1	#	She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
1	#	What is that?
1	#	So join in.
1	#	All right.
1	#	Hey, wh-what--
1	#	Well Lisi, that was another-
1	#	Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
1	#	Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
1	#	Riverside Park.
1	#	Back to my place. That's right.
1	#	She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the Lopper, So I let her stay over.
1	#	Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--
1	#	How'd it taste?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship weekend place.
1	#	Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her the wrong message.
1	#	Well, I'm calling this off right now.
1	#	Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper is.
1	#	Hi, Lisi.
1	#	Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth something.
1	#	Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.
1	#	Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?
1	#	Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what I set out to do.
1	#	Have we even been in public?
1	#	You are not dumb. Don't say that..
1	#	These beans are pretty good.
1	#	Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!
1	#	Nice to meet ya!
1	#	Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?
1	#	We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
1	#	Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little more time. See how it looks in the light of day.
1	#	Lopper.
1	#	Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, you were right. I'll do anything!
1	#	No. I'm waiting for...
1	#	Oh. Sounds great.
1	#	Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.
1	#	Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car so I don't toss it in that dumpster?
1	#	A long, long weekend.
1	#	Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.
1	#	By yourself?
1	#	Game over.
1	#	I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open for a rodeo.
1	#	Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
1	#	You mean like...Liza!
1	#	But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?
1	#	There's a g-spot.
1	#	T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.
1	#	They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
1	#	Oh, I had that comin' to me.
1	#	You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
1	#	I hired her from a service!
1	#	Thank you. Nice job.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	What?
1	#	Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
1	#	She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or a...news woman.
1	#	You have a girlfriend?
1	#	At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
1	#	It's like 10 minutes by subway.
1	#	That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all the new numbers are 646.
1	#	Here we go.
1	#	And a dead bolt.
1	#	Well Cindy, the place looks great.
1	#	Ok, I'll see ya.
1	#	Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation so obviously fraught with potential complications?
1	#	No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
1	#	I was going to say, "Being a good host."
1	#	But the point is we have our personal relationship, and we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some what sophisticated.
1	#	Yes, I do.
1	#	Yes, we have.
1	#	The store.
1	#	Stuff.
1	#	And gum.
1	#	She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
1	#	Kramer, you're still on the phone?
1	#	Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
1	#	Madeline stays here.
1	#	Hey, T-bone!
1	#	No T-bone?
1	#	No! There's no T-bone!
1	#	Why no T-bone?
1	#	Yes.
1	#	No.
1	#	Yeah. It's in your closet.
1	#	They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
1	#	Where you goin'?
1	#	Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.
1	#	What did I just pay for?
1	#	Koko?
1	#	Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.
1	#	Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' for sex.
1	#	No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like I'm seein' a prostitute.
1	#	40
1	#	I don't know what this is.
1	#	Ooh.
1	#	I look about the same.
1	#	I was talking to him.
1	#	Never mind.
1	#	What?
1	#	Go back.
1	#	I said, never mind.
1	#	I hate the counter.
1	#	Hey.
1	#	Oh, she didn't mind?
1	#	Hey, that's great.
1	#	Elaine got a new number because she died.
1	#	Some new kind of pie.
1	#	Hey, there's a booth.
1	#	So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
1	#	Double zero?
1	#	Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
1	#	Good-bye, Koko.
1	#	Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.
1	#	I didn't hear anything.
1	#	Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your outfit.
1	#	For what?
1	#	But you didn't really do any work.
1	#	But you took a nap in it.
1	#	I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
1	#	Well, who took the nap?
1	#	$40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
1	#	Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.
1	#	So is this a breakup/quitting?
1	#	Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!
1	#	So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
1	#	Miss.
1	#	I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
1	#	Elaine...
1	#	Hello?
1	#	I accept.
1	#	Well, what happened?
1	#	What's around you?
1	#	Is it Famous Ray's?
1	#	Famous Original Ray's?
1	#	Well, what street are you on?
1	#	Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive no matter what occurs, I will find you!
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Cindy.
1	#	You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to do.
1	#	Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.
1	#	What?
1	#	I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.
1	#	Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy.
1	#	Here. I got your money.
1	#	Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
1	#	Well, this is all very sophisticated.
1	#	Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
1	#	I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of the game.
1	#	Keep your shirt on. I got it.
1	#	Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
1	#	Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He accelerated.
1	#	How was it?
1	#	Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg flights that made it.
1	#	Heh.
1	#	Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled that out at the actual disaster.
1	#	What is that music?
1	#	Oh, no.
1	#	See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.
1	#	I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. It makes me anxious.
1	#	But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how am I gonna get all the way over there?
1	#	All right, I'm worming.
1	#	They're not letting me in.
1	#	Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have to see a human face.
1	#	The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
1	#	One more lane to go.
1	#	Maroon Golf.
1	#	Could you move your car back a little?
1	#	You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
1	#	Can you believe her?
1	#	Where are you going?
1	#	You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid line?
1	#	That's not what I do.
1	#	Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.
1	#	I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we could get out of here.
1	#	Walk away?
1	#	Isn't there a deductible?
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	From what?
1	#	We're not leaving the car!
1	#	Absolutely not. He sped up.
1	#	I'm ready to talk.
1	#	What's that?
1	#	Ok!
1	#	What's that on your forehead?
1	#	Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?
1	#	See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.
1	#	I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, jackass!
1	#	Elaine?!
1	#	So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?
1	#	Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
1	#	Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! We were almost out!
1	#	Elaine, he doesn't need-
1	#	Cause that's what's gonna happen.
1	#	I don't know.
1	#	Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.
1	#	Hey, there's the soda guy.
1	#	What seems to be the problem, officer?
1	#	At me?
1	#	Oh. It's back.
1	#	What if it gets in the side?
1	#	Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more intense, until finally-
1	#	Oh. It's in your eye now.
1	#	Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!
1	#	You were watchin'? Where?
1	#	Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!
1	#	Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues me. Why is it called the TV room?
1	#	Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
1	#	Not Pennypacker!
1	#	I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!
1	#	Oh, hello...
1	#	Mr. Vandelay, of course.
1	#	Pennypacker.
1	#	Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?
1	#	The Saab factory?
1	#	My car!
1	#	I love a parade!
1	#	Well, what about my car?
1	#	Hey, there's Elaine.
1	#	Well, you look, uh...relaxed.
1	#	Well, at least he didn't-
1	#	Somebody remember where we parked.
1	#	I know what you mean.
1	#	It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
1	#	Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.
1	#	So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
1	#	To see a movie.
1	#	Not this movie.
1	#	Did you shower today?
1	#	That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
1	#	Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.
1	#	What is that?
1	#	Ey, ey!
1	#	Nothing.
1	#	Have a good time.
1	#	You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
1	#	Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
1	#	Faux pas.
1	#	You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't want to take up any of my important time in my home so I'll just get it out of the way on the street."
1	#	It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
1	#	It's pompous.
1	#	Hey - hey - hey!
1	#	Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.
1	#	Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.
1	#	Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough.
1	#	He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about "Jerry."
1	#	Right.
1	#	Yeah!
1	#	Today, like right now.
1	#	"Jerry"!
1	#	He wants to talk about "Jerry"!
1	#	"Jerry"!
1	#	Sure!
1	#	Forget the sports jacket.
1	#	You're not a writer.
1	#	Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.
1	#	Don't blow this.
1	#	If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.
1	#	He might not want nothing.
1	#	He might want a show about anything and everything.
1	#	All right.
1	#	What?
1	#	Good, good. You remember George.
1	#	Don't spell.
1	#	Shut up, George.
1	#	Oy.
1	#	Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right?
1	#	Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than "coffee machine show."
1	#	But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
1	#	He's a little off the wall.
1	#	Definitely.
1	#	Yeah!
1	#	Hi. Elaine, it's me.
1	#	No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
1	#	The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California!
1	#	Did you hear what I said?
1	#	Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?
1	#	So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk.
1	#	Yeah, it's pretty good.
1	#	NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye.
1	#	Hey - how was the beach?
1	#	I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
1	#	So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They're putting it on the air! They're giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California!
1	#	Yeah, only for a while.
1	#	No, I'll be back.
1	#	And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.
1	#	Anywhere.
1	#	I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years.
1	#	Russia, it's so bleak.
1	#	It's still bleak.
1	#	You can be bleak in spring.
1	#	Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to agree on anything. Why don't we all just go to Paris?
1	#	So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.
1	#	Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that conversation.
1	#	First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you're talking about a plane call?
1	#	Hello, Newman. What gives?
1	#	Yeah, that's right.
1	#	Really.
1	#	That's a shame.
1	#	Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	All set. We'll just grab the bags.
1	#	Just keeps on getting better and better.
1	#	Not bad.
1	#	You're complaining about a private jet?
1	#	Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
1	#	You're not writing any letters!
1	#	Still got water in your ear?
1	#	Kramer, what the hell did you do?
1	#	Kramer!
1	#	Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	What? What is it?
1	#	What?
1	#	Why?
1	#	Great - I won.
1	#	Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.
1	#	Alright.
1	#	We're straightening out!
1	#	Where are we?
1	#	Okay.
1	#	We'll see you later.
1	#	I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.
1	#	Alright, I'll feel him out.
1	#	Another one?
1	#	Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
1	#	That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.
1	#	Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.
1	#	No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.
1	#	Under arrest? What for?
1	#	Oh, yeah.
1	#	But then we would have missed the whole thing.
1	#	I forgot about the video.
1	#	Plane's ready.
1	#	You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.
1	#	It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
1	#	Good morning.
1	#	No.
1	#	This one?
1	#	Do I have to?
1	#	Yeah.
1	#	Well, there goes the money for the lipo.
1	#	Gimme that rye.
1	#	I want that rye lady.
1	#	Shut up, you old bag!
1	#	The virgin!
1	#	Who the hell is that?
1	#	That's right, the Bubble Boy.
1	#	He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
1	#	Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
1	#	Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
1	#	Who?
1	#	Medium crab bisque.
1	#	Just forget it. Let it go.
1	#	How did they find Babu?
1	#	Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
1	#	It's not that bright orange one is it?
1	#	Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?
1	#	Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
1	#	What?
1	#	Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back
1	#	Sure.
1	#	I think that would be a very nice gesture.
1	#	See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.
1	#	Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.
1	#	You think?
1	#	Yeah, maybe we have.
1	#	So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?
1	#	I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?
1	#	Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for?
1	#	Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
1	#	Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand.
1	#	Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.
2	#	Yeah, I do that too. I feel guilty about getting the pleasure. I feel like I don't deserve it so I talk. It stops me from enjoying it. There's nothing to eat in here.
2	#	Why don't you ever go shopping?
2	#	Not even an apple.
2	#	What about this leftover Chinese food?
2	#	(he just took a bite of the Chinese food ) This is terrible. What is this, ginger? I hate ginger. I can't understand how anyone can eat ginger. (puts the container back in the refrigerator.)
2	#	Physical therapy is covered by insurance?
2	#	You don't have to pay for the massage?
2	#	Right, your friend Roy.
2	#	And you don't have to pay.
2	#	We have a, three-o'clock appointments.
2	#	Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?
2	#	But, uh, Raymond is a man.
2	#	I can't get a massage from a man.
2	#	What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
2	#	What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
2	#	He'd just be touching your back too.
2	#	I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
2	#	I would? What if something happens?
2	#	What if it felt good?
2	#	I don't want it to feel good.
2	#	Exactly!
2	#	Yes?
2	#	Hello.(with not a big smile)
2	#	Really.
2	#	Oh boy.
2	#	What?
2	#	I-I don't know.
2	#	Nah.
2	#	hu, Coffee. Too much coffee (nervous laughter).
2	#	Oh, the hamstrings fine.
2	#	I wrote. Pfft, *I* wrote.
2	#	Are you sure?
2	#	I don't know.
2	#	No.
2	#	Korea.
2	#	What?
2	#	Korea.
2	#	Hamstring.
2	#	Hotel.
2	#	A... ah...
2	#	A man gave me...
2	#	A man gave me... a massage. hu, hu
2	#	So he... had his hands and, uh, he was uh
2	#	He-he was uh touching and rubbing. (nervous laugh)
2	#	And then I took my pants off.
2	#	For my hamstring.
2	#	He got about uh, two inches from... there.
2	#	I think it moved.
2	#	It may have moved, I don't know.
2	#	It moved! It was imperceptible but I-I felt it.
2	#	No, no. It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.
2	#	That's the sign! The test; if a - if a man makes it move.
2	#	You think it's contact? It has to be touched?
2	#	I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch.
2	#	I don't even like to use urinals, always been a stall man.
2	#	The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts. What about this doctor's note? Let's go see your friend Roy.
2	#	What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks! I'm not working, I can't afford that.
2	#	Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?
2	#	All right -- (Gets up to leave)
2	#	He didn't say he can't.
2	#	He doesn't feel funny.
2	#	Do you feel funny? He didn't say anything.
2	#	He knows that!
2	#	Oh, can you be any more dramatic?
2	#	How would I know?
2	#	What do you mean, like him?
2	#	I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.
2	#	Why should I?
2	#	Nothing, why? You think something's wrong? Am I different?
2	#	These kids called me a Mary.
2	#	I was jumping over a puddle, and for some reason I went like this. (George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion) And they called me a Mary. So I chased them, and I tripped and I fell.
2	#	Told me what?
2	#	He didn't say anything.
2	#	No Doctor--
2	#	Hello.
2	#	How ya doing?
2	#	Me neither.
2	#	Me too.
2	#	Tragic.
2	#	No?
2	#	Unsettling?
2	#	Me neither. I've never been happy.
2	#	In college, maybe. Those were fun times.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	I've just met her but I'm very impressed.
2	#	How ya doing?
2	#	Hello.
2	#	Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies. All of a sudden I'll be, in the middle.
2	#	And a guy will appear from out of nowhere. I say "Get out of here! What do you want? You don't belong here!"
2	#	They talk back. They go, "Hey George, how's it going?" I say, "Get the hell out of here!"
2	#	You see? Now that is a handsome man. (Elaine and Jerry look right at George) Oh please.
2	#	I don't understand. Paper Machay hats?
2	#	What if it rains?
2	#	Oh, art!
2	#	Any money in it?
2	#	Of course, right.
2	#	Tommy C.
2	#	I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.
2	#	Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.
2	#	No, no,
2	#	I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.
2	#	I have a fear of intimacy
2	#	Nothing. It's not YOU..
2	#	The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much more. You're pretentious. You call everyone by their full name You call my doorman, Sammy, "Samuel" but you didn't even say "Samuel" You went "Sam - U- EL" Papie-eh Mach-eh What is Papie-ay Mach-ay?
2	#	I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little harsh.
2	#	Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?
2	#	Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...
2	#	George
2	#	My whole life has been a complete waste of time, (chuckle)
2	#	Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple. Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth
2	#	Oh, oh, your papers
2	#	No. I did.
2	#	...I broke up with her.
2	#	I broke up with her.
2	#	It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.
2	#	Oh, no. We left on good terms.
2	#	Because I uh, I told her the truth.
2	#	It's OK.
2	#	She asked me to.
2	#	I told her that she was pretentious.
2	#	Like what? What could they say?
2	#	Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?
2	#	Give me one.
2	#	Yes.
2	#	I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't believe this. How could you say that to me?
2	#	You should have lied.
2	#	(ignoring Jerry) I mean I'm not really working right now.
2	#	When I was working I spent baby.
2	#	She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.
2	#	Give me the phone. (dials) Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ... what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... (hangs up)
2	#	She never came back from lunch.
2	#	(dials) Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, (hangs up) She hung up.
2	#	All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize. I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. (exits)
2	#	No, no she wasn't.
2	#	No, I didn't.
2	#	A mental institution.
2	#	It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over this.
2	#	Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.
2	#	She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.
2	#	I don't know.
2	#	Where?
2	#	We could.
2	#	I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.
2	#	I should be in a place like this. I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association tests. I love those.
2	#	Potato
2	#	Blanket
2	#	Grass
2	#	Oh, boy. Here she comes.
2	#	Oh, this is my friend Jerry.
2	#	Pretentious? Who, who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental institution.
2	#	No, that's not it at all.
2	#	I'M NOT A LIER!
2	#	Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)
2	#	All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.
2	#	What I said? I say stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.
2	#	You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.
2	#	Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.
2	#	I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks, Supposed to be good.
2	#	Hey, I'm getting in on that.
2	#	You're going that way anyway!
2	#	Prognosis Negative! (in a funny voice)
2	#	Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha ha!!!
2	#	Can't go, Why not?
2	#	I thought Kramer was watching.
2	#	Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.
2	#	You spritz a little Lysol on it.
2	#	So we're not going?
2	#	Oh. You still wanna go?
2	#	If you want.
2	#	Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
2	#	What about this--
2	#	It's just we want you to go.
2	#	So how long did you live there?
2	#	That's pretty long.
2	#	It's not that long, really.
2	#	And then you came here.
2	#	I like herbal tea.
2	#	Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
2	#	Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
2	#	Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.
2	#	You don't tell him?
2	#	That is so funny!
2	#	Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!
2	#	Prognosis Negative! (again in a funny voice)
2	#	Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?
2	#	What does this mean?
2	#	What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.
2	#	Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?
2	#	Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
2	#	And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
2	#	Hey, go.
2	#	What, are you doing me a favor?
2	#	How's it going?
2	#	Things are good.
2	#	I know.
2	#	Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
2	#	How come we never hear him?
2	#	Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!
2	#	Oh.
2	#	I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm out of conversation.
2	#	All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get, I could always read the sports section.
2	#	Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
2	#	Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
2	#	I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but it's this or nothing.
2	#	What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.
2	#	So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.
2	#	Of course it is.
2	#	Exactly.
2	#	Right.
2	#	And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.
2	#	Good.
2	#	Ridiculous!
2	#	Oh, you're dead.
2	#	Jerry, Jerry
2	#	I think I saw him. I think it's him.
2	#	Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some calesthetics routine
2	#	I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.
2	#	He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.
2	#	(yells) I didn't tattle
2	#	There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
2	#	Some other time.
2	#	Let's see if it's Hayman?
2	#	I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?
2	#	He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say, "Can't stand ja". "Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.
2	#	OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.
2	#	Little baked beans
2	#	Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ... ME!
2	#	... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...
2	#	Yes, Mr. Hayman
2	#	Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
2	#	I'm not really sure, I...
2	#	He gave me a wedgie.
2	#	Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..
2	#	I gotta go back to the library and talk to him. I gotta find out if I&Mac226;m the guy who ruined his life.
2	#	Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it
2	#	It's George
2	#	Well, it's definetly him.
2	#	Him who? Hayman him.
2	#	Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus
2	#	So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move. So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library , a grown man, getting a wedgie.
2	#	It was.
2	#	How should I know?
2	#	Me?
2	#	The locker room!
2	#	Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.
2	#	Yes Mr. Hayman.
2	#	Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
2	#	I'm not really sure, I...
2	#	(shouting) No No No!
2	#	Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.
2	#	One left...what a joke.
2	#	No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time.
2	#	You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire.
2	#	Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.
2	#	Fish. What do they do?
2	#	What time is it?
2	#	Always late. Always late.
2	#	I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen.
2	#	My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic?
2	#	I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush.
2	#	Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that.
2	#	Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" JERRY Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.
2	#	You don't know where we parked?
2	#	Oh, this is great.
2	#	This is just what I need.
2	#	There's elevators all over! It all looks the same.
2	#	(MUMBLING) You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that?
2	#	It's this way... AND THEY TAKE OFF AGAIN, PAIRING OFF
2	#	...Six wrong?
2	#	Oh I got it. (TO JERRY) That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant.
2	#	I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades.
2	#	Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
2	#	What?
2	#	I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.
2	#	(TO WOMAN) Hey, is that necessary?
2	#	I think hitting a defenseless child is my business.
2	#	...What?
2	#	You are!
2	#	I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day.
2	#	Oh are they gonna be furious.
2	#	Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story.
2	#	Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes.
2	#	If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.
2	#	Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually.
2	#	Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you?
2	#	See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you?
2	#	Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do?
2	#	(NOT INTERESTED) Really.
2	#	Who's Killer Kowalski?
2	#	I've gotta go to the bathroom.
2	#	Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life...
2	#	(TO JERRY, SOMEWHAT IMPRESSED) A Red Chinese prison?
2	#	(PROUDLY) Me too.
2	#	Elaine, shut-up.
2	#	I don't know. (TO ELAINE) Where's Kramer?
2	#	See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen...
2	#	(CONT'D) Look at the time, that's it.
2	#	We came in over there!
2	#	So what do you want me to do?
2	#	That is an opening.
2	#	(CONT'D) Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if...
2	#	You will?
2	#	Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here.
2	#	Yeah, right.
2	#	It's a blue Honda...
2	#	Hi Amy, I'm George.
2	#	(TALKING IN PASSENGER WINDOW) I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were...
2	#	(CONT'D) ...with that group.
2	#	The car!
2	#	Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer!
2	#	Purple 23.
2	#	Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down.
2	#	Seven forty-five.
2	#	Right.
2	#	Eight o'clock.
2	#	She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don'tnice.
2	#	Why is nice bad? What kind a of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?
2	#	What, a 'little' cologne.
2	#	Monica wants me to wear it.
2	#	I'm too nice.
2	#	She wants me to take an IQ test.
2	#	No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, so I have to be a guinea pig.
2	#	You know, I can't talk to you anymore.
2	#	Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.
2	#	I'm not going to break a hundred on this thing.
2	#	You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!
2	#	I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.
2	#	What did I get or what do I say I got?
2	#	I say fourteen o nine (1409).
2	#	Psst, You're telling me.
2	#	You are my friend.
2	#	I tell you everything, right?
2	#	Well, this I take to the grave.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	I'm wearing some cologne, all right?
2	#	What's that?
2	#	Why is what I do is so important? Why must I be always the focal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.
2	#	I didn't take it, yet.
2	#	What's casus belli.
2	#	Is it about me?
2	#	Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.
2	#	It varies.
2	#	145!
2	#	Shst, You should take the test for me.
2	#	Haha (laughs)
2	#	Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why don't we do it again?
2	#	You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out a window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.
2	#	Why not?
2	#	I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.
2	#	You'll do it?
2	#	Yeaah, beautiful... (They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.) Sorry...
2	#	You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.
2	#	I won't be able to, concentrate in front of you.
2	#	Are you kidding me? [Elaine walks past the window glancing in] This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons' intelligence.
2	#	Well, I think you're wrong about that. [Elaine walks past the window again, glancing in] And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.
2	#	Don't need it. N'huhuhu (laughs)
2	#	I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this - hhe.
2	#	Ah, ah, twenty to three.
2	#	Thanks again.
2	#	A-and don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. Heheheh (laughs)
2	#	Yeah?
2	#	Oh, it's locked?
2	#	Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. (turns to the next page)
2	#	Wish I could. (raises the magazine up in front of his face and continues reading.)
2	#	What did you go on a picnic?
2	#	Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?
2	#	U-ok. (George closes the window and shoos Elaine off. He opens the door to Monica.) Here you go.
2	#	Piece of cake; hu.
2	#	What? Oh I spilled some food on it.
2	#	What are you talking about?
2	#	From my pocket.
2	#	I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.
2	#	Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.
2	#	Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, at the grocery store. (small laugh)
2	#	I walked.
2	#	I climbed out the window.
2	#	Of course.
2	#	The door? Why would I go out the door? The window's right here.
2	#	Coming up.
2	#	85!
2	#	85, Jerry! 85 IQ !
2	#	Oh, hello Professor.
2	#	Please...
2	#	You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.
2	#	Ooh ho hoo, forget it.
2	#	You could do worse!
2	#	All right, I'll ask her.
2	#	How' you doing?
2	#	Hunh, You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to, to get a cup of coffee...
2	#	Come on, lets not stand here too long, we might run in to her.
2	#	That's a good score.
2	#	Italian.
2	#	Hey! what are listening to?
2	#	Oh! you taped it?
2	#	Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .
2	#	Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.
2	#	Yeah. Did you do it?
2	#	So?
2	#	Need to use the phone.
2	#	China.
2	#	Yeah. I'll pay for it.
2	#	What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.
2	#	The Chinese have done it my friend. The Chinese have done it.
2	#	Discovered a cure for baldness.
2	#	It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau. has discovered a cure for baldness.
2	#	Is that the guy who likes fat women?
2	#	I did, I'm trying to call China.
2	#	What?
2	#	(George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...
2	#	Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?
2	#	This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?
2	#	WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?
2	#	My god!!!
2	#	All right, All right, all, right!!( gives the headphones to Kramer) How you gonna find out who this is?
2	#	What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
2	#	This woman left this really sexy message on Jerry's tape recorder......
2	#	What??
2	#	I thought you meant the..
2	#	Oh!, he he, It was unbelievable
2	#	Yeah. I can't get over it.
2	#	This woman drove us out of our minds
2	#	She had this throaty , sexy kind of whisper.
2	#	Oh! my God!!......You?.....You?...That was you?....
2	#	how did ya?...
2	#	Oh! no no nothing....
2	#	I had no Idea you were filled with such....sexuality..
2	#	Ah! Some bald thing, a bald thing I dunno. It's nothing
2	#	Peter?
2	#	Wh.. Where you going?
2	#	Why you going home for?
2	#	Oh! my god. Oh! man...
2	#	(phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing?
2	#	Why do I do anything? tsss...For women.
2	#	Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?
2	#	Do you speak English?...English!!
2	#	English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.
2	#	In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone) Follow meeeee... is George Costanza, he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from Rome and I'm about to show him how much I've missed him.
2	#	(visibly disturbed) I...I..I dunno.
2	#	All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English
2	#	Huh. Excuse me (to Ping) Hum... Do you speak chinese?
2	#	Look...humm..I'm on with Beijing with the hair restauration clinic. Could you talk to them for me and tell them I'd like to place an order.
2	#	They got a billion people over there and he found a relative.
2	#	They send me? Aw right ..ask 'em Does it really work?
2	#	Ask' em Are there any side effects?

2	#	No, no....(mumbles)
2	#	Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good doing that porno thing....you're talented.
2	#	I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.
2	#	So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.
2	#	Guess, what I got.
2	#	From China. All the way from China.
2	#	No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe in the Chinese.
2	#	Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.
2	#	All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)
2	#	All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)
2	#	Is that Elaine?
2	#	HI ELAINE...
2	#	Did she say Hello?
2	#	I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?
2	#	Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?
2	#	Elaine's coming up?
2	#	Yeah, that was enough.
2	#	No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?
2	#	It's George.
2	#	I have to talk to you about something .
2	#	Aahh..No..No..
2	#	I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.
2	#	I can't.
2	#	All right.........I've become attracted to Elaine..
2	#	Kramer, can we do this later..
2	#	Really? ..You think.
2	#	So now you're doing my bits?
2	#	NO!!
2	#	I can't say.
2	#	Because I promised her.
2	#	She doesn't.
2	#	Because she asked me to.
2	#	All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice on your tape recorder.
2	#	Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.
2	#	Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)
2	#	You heard it fifty times already.
2	#	(Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything, she'll kill me!!
2	#	He..He threatened me.
2	#	Elaine.. I have to tell you something...
2	#	No no no no no no no..
2	#	I'm very attracted to you..
2	#	Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...
2	#	Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.
2	#	Where'd you meet her?
2	#	On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?
2	#	You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb. What got into you?
2	#	Wow. What'd you say?
2	#	Wow.
2	#	What did she say?
2	#	Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?
2	#	What?
2	#	Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all afternoon.
2	#	I had a job interview.
2	#	Take a guess.
2	#	Ok, thanks.
2	#	Yeah, right.
2	#	Oh, nothing.
2	#	You won't think I'm a bad person?
2	#	Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.
2	#	I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.
2	#	Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little short of perfection.
2	#	So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.
2	#	I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.
2	#	(waving) How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.
2	#	Why don't you just commit yourself already?
2	#	What, you didn't wash all day?
2	#	Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?
2	#	Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause) So how about that Kramer, huh?
2	#	They way he just says stuff.
2	#	Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.
2	#	About the pizza?
2	#	Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?
2	#	Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.
2	#	Peter Jennings had one.
2	#	Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...
2	#	It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.
2	#	It's a cleaning.
2	#	If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.
2	#	What the hell.
2	#	Me? I didn't say anything.
2	#	I didn't encourage. No encourage.
2	#	It's possible.
2	#	Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.
2	#	I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.
2	#	(checking his watch) Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the bandages off at four o'clock.
2	#	It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.
2	#	Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...
2	#	You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
2	#	He still wins but it's not a blowout.
2	#	Good for you.
2	#	It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.
2	#	Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,
2	#	Yeah?
2	#	Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.
2	#	Too much salt in my diet.
2	#	Nah, I'm good.
2	#	Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?
2	#	It's like, all dented.
2	#	Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--
2	#	Shut up?
2	#	Interesting.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Oh, I got it.
2	#	Yeah, phew.
2	#	What?
2	#	We did?
2	#	Hawaii?
2	#	(removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.
2	#	Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
2	#	You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.
2	#	(smitten) Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!
2	#	(interrupting) Elaine. Shut up.
2	#	Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they got in his carpet.
2	#	That's not funny. So, are you coming to the party?
2	#	You know Ava's gonna be there.
2	#	The nice one that works in my office.
2	#	I'll drive.
2	#	It's supposed to be a good party.
2	#	No, there'll be girls there.
2	#	There's a hundred different things here. What's the difference between these two? (They each grab a box and check the ingredients) You got propylparabin?
2	#	You got isobutane-30?
2	#	A-ha.
2	#	Got it.
2	#	You got aloe? I love aloe.
2	#	Jersey.
2	#	I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.
2	#	(to the cashier) Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you only actually gave me change for a ten.
2	#	I'm positive I gave you a twenty.
2	#	You owe me ten dollars.
2	#	Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second. Who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake? Me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there? Or you--
2	#	No, no, no, see you're not really listening.
2	#	No problem. There's no problem. She just owes me ten dollars, that's all.
2	#	Oh, so you don't believe me either?
2	#	You haven't won. You may think you've won, but you haven't won. Do you know why? It's not over. This is not over. I'm not forgetting what's happening here. You have my ten dollars. I will get it back. Alright, don't worry. It's not over. I'm going now. Good bye. I will be back.
2	#	(waving Eva.
2	#	Oh no you didn't. Get out, when?
2	#	I don't believe it.
2	#	Mark, is this true?
2	#	How's it going?
2	#	I can't believe what's happening here. She hasn't taken her hands off me all night. She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.
2	#	I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.
2	#	No, I would have picked up on it. I can always tell when a woman likes me, they always somehow let you know. With me, they could torture me, I wouldn't tell them. If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them, then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must have something going for him."
2	#	Now?
2	#	Gimme a half-hour.
2	#	Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.
2	#	I think something's happening here.
2	#	I think she wants me to take her home.
2	#	What should I do?
2	#	What about you and Elaine?
2	#	Are you sure?
2	#	She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs passes) She told me she wants me to make love to her.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	I swear.
2	#	I, I, I can't.
2	#	Please, it's--
2	#	I... I... I long for you.
2	#	I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.
2	#	I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.
2	#	That's a lot of pressure. Make love to me. What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?
2	#	I can't perform under pressure. That's why I never play anything for money, I choke. I could choke tonight. And she works in my office, can you imagine? She goes around telling everyone what happened? Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.
2	#	I know, I know, I can't stop it!
2	#	Yeah, good night.
2	#	Could we talk about this some other time?
2	#	Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect. Anyway-
2	#	Goldfish.
2	#	That's why we're here in America.
2	#	Yeah, me either.
2	#	What come on? Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?
2	#	You know the anxiety you feel on a date? That's what I have every day now. My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.
2	#	Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a friend. Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her. Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk. I have to plan little patter. I spend half my day writing. Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went. If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day. I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me. I want to go back there again.'
2	#	I have no choice, I'm quitting.
2	#	How much is that?
2	#	Nine sixty? Give it to me.
2	#	Don't worry, I got it.
2	#	I got it.
2	#	I'm not stealing it. They owe me ten dollars. They stole from me.
2	#	I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.
2	#	Just walk.
2	#	What?
2	#	Oh, I was gonna pay for this.
2	#	(nervous) Where are you taking me? I was gonna pay for it.
2	#	(more nervous) What are you talking about?
2	#	(panicky) What are you gonna do? Are you gonna call the police?
2	#	You had Sgt. Chadway? Me too.
2	#	Oh, great guy.
2	#	The one with the long sideburns?
2	#	Where does he come off?
2	#	One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.
2	#	Was the alarm on?
2	#	I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?
2	#	Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.
2	#	Maybe you should call your car phone.
2	#	Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.
2	#	Yeah, go ahead, call.
2	#	Who's Sid?
2	#	What do you mean?
2	#	What, do you pay him for that?
2	#	How many people does he do that for?
2	#	Could anybody do that?
2	#	You are?
2	#	How'd you get that?
2	#	Right out of the clear blue sky?
2	#	Well, why didn't they ask me?
2	#	Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?
2	#	Maybe I could move them until you get back.
2	#	I'm in a transition phase right now.
2	#	I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I do?! Help me! Help me!
2	#	You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?
2	#	You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?
2	#	Is that how you're gonna say it?
2	#	"These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"
2	#	That was no good?
2	#	What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright! Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me thirsty!
2	#	Oh man.
2	#	Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen) Who's he?
2	#	What happened?
2	#	I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen and I got all distracted.
2	#	Woody mentioned me? What did he say?
2	#	Should I apologize to Woody?
2	#	Well I know how to drive.
2	#	I put my pants on, Sid.
2	#	Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.
2	#	Maybe I could call my father.
2	#	Do I smell?
2	#	He's alright?
2	#	No no no, I got it.
2	#	No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two thousand dollars,
2	#	Get out of here, why?
2	#	Like you do.
2	#	What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
2	#	Why did France give that to us anyway?
2	#	So countries just exchange gifts like that?
2	#	There's Elaine.
2	#	Really? They work here in the office?
2	#	Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.
2	#	Really?
2	#	"Off the wagon"?
2	#	I think it's "on the wagon".
2	#	Well today's your lucky day.
2	#	It will be my first one.
2	#	Huh?
2	#	How can you just get it?
2	#	Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.
2	#	I like Mike Lubika.
2	#	He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...
2	#	Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.
2	#	Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.
2	#	He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.
2	#	Venetian Blinds.
2	#	I think he was impressed.
2	#	Told you.
2	#	Do I really have to buy her something?
2	#	What is that? Is that cashmere?
2	#	Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.
2	#	Wow. Excuse me, Miss?
2	#	How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
2	#	What? I don't see anything.
2	#	Oh yeah.
2	#	(grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?
2	#	You think she would care about the red dot?
2	#	I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
2	#	Yeah, but you know where it is.
2	#	Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
2	#	Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?
2	#	Please.
2	#	(over the speaker) It's George.
2	#	Hello everybody.
2	#	(uncomfortablly) Thank you.
2	#	It's an early Christmas present.
2	#	For you.
2	#	Of course it's cashmere.
2	#	Well who doesn't.
2	#	Ahh, money.
2	#	Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.
2	#	Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
2	#	What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?
2	#	I can't believe I get paid for this.
2	#	How you doing?
2	#	Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.
2	#	Why is that?
2	#	So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)
2	#	Convulsing?
2	#	Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
2	#	I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.
2	#	So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.
2	#	Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.
2	#	(over the speaker) It's George.
2	#	I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.
2	#	Did you tell her anything?
2	#	Do you swear?
2	#	Oh you told her didn't you.
2	#	What? Did I what?
2	#	Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.
2	#	You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.
2	#	Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.
2	#	This is for you.
2	#	As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.
2	#	Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.
2	#	Of course it's cashemere.
2	#	Just a little something for Christmas.
2	#	I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.
2	#	Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
2	#	Who said that?
2	#	Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.
2	#	Well you didn't have to say it like that.
2	#	What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?
2	#	You never had sex in the office before?
2	#	Alright so you made out with someone.
2	#	Kissing is sex.
2	#	Jerry.
2	#	No.
2	#	Over here.
2	#	Hide, hide under the desk.
2	#	Of course it's cashmere.
2	#	945
2	#	Why not?
2	#	What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging. The biggest loser in history of American literature.
2	#	Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out, what do they flip a coin?
2	#	What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate question.
2	#	I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking "That's why I'm not heterosexual".
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	How many tickets are you paying today?
2	#	No doors?
2	#	I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.
2	#	That guy is not blind.
2	#	I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.
2	#	That's amazing.
2	#	What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second interview with them.
2	#	Me, why?
2	#	Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages. Here it is. Looking for the quotes. Gotta check to quotes. Love a good quote. Oh, IBM up a quarter.
2	#	Me? No, no, I don't, I don't. Doing very well, very well, yep.
2	#	Yeah I'm, eh, in 'the market'.
2	#	Which market, the, eh, big one, the big market, the big board. Bull market, bear market, you name the market, I'm there.
2	#	They wish. I hate the big broker-houses. Hate them with a passion. Big broker-houses killed my father.
2	#	Well, they hurt him bad. Really hurt his feelings. It's a long story. I- I don't like to talk about it, but I swore then that I would never work for big broker-houses. See, all they care about is money. I'm about more than money, I'm about people, always gone my own way and I've never looked back.
2	#	Oh, you do?
2	#	No, no, what, what?
2	#	Yeah, well....
2	#	Hey, what's another million, give or take. I get off where and when I wanna get off.
2	#	I'm stuck. Pull a little, just a second. Don't start the train! Don't start the train!!
2	#	Are you often on business trip? Nice...oh, hey nice ice-bucket.
2	#	Gotta tell you I'm pretty comfortable.
2	#	Eh, gee, I hope you have the key for these things.
2	#	You know, my mother used to walk around on our apartment just in her bra and panties. She didn't look anything like you, she was really disgusting, really bad body. If you could imagine uglier and fatter version of Shirley Booth. Remember Shirley Booth from Hazel. Really embarrassing, cause you know I had only mother in the whole neighborhood who was worse looking than Hazel. Imagine the taunts I would hear.
2	#	Like a "Hey your mother is uglier than Hazel. Hazel really puts your mother to shame"
2	#	What's going on?
2	#	Get going? But we haven't really, you know....
2	#	What are you doing? You're robbing me?
2	#	Wait, wait a second, what are you doing?
2	#	No, that's my only suit. It cost me 350 dollars. I got it at Moe Ginsburg.
2	#	No wait, you can't just leave me here! Will I see you again?
2	#	How would you like a 'Hare Krishna' fist on your throat, you little punk?
2	#	You have my spare-key in your apartment, right?
2	#	Give me your key, I gotta get it.
2	#	Never mind what happened, just give me the key.
2	#	...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a *brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the *Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!
2	#	We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*! Y'know?
2	#	I was telling you about Noel.
2	#	[sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...
2	#	What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?
2	#	No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...
2	#	How do I get the hand?
2	#	She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...
2	#	Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself. Maybe I can get some hand that way.
2	#	With all due respect, I don't think so...
2	#	What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!
2	#	What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?
2	#	Hey, what goes on there, exactly?
2	#	No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...
2	#	*No*...
2	#	All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...
2	#	I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.
2	#	What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first place?
2	#	What kind of a sick impulse does that??
2	#	What are we gonna tell her?
2	#	No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then I'm a *jerk*...
2	#	Hey, hey! We're discussing something!
2	#	What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
2	#	Uh, can we cut to the chase?
2	#	Yeah...
2	#	A lot of people say it.
2	#	[Accusingly] What's *that*?
2	#	[Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
2	#	Y'know people, we got a situation over here!
2	#	All right, OK, I'm goin' in.
2	#	Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.
2	#	Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel
2	#	Me, uh, uh, no, ...
2	#	If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)
2	#	All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.
2	#	We'll have a good time
2	#	Ah, come on
2	#	Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]
2	#	It's George
2	#	Well it's over. It's definitely over.
2	#	No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation. I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.
2	#	Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,
2	#	Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said "no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.
2	#	Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.
2	#	I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.
2	#	What?
2	#	A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose. We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.
2	#	So, I am have to going to break up with you.
2	#	I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.
2	#	Shocked?
2	#	Never expected this did you?
2	#	Well, live and learn.
2	#	Kind of.
2	#	Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.
2	#	Now, stop it ...
2	#	When you're playing the piano do you think about me?

2	#	Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont come with me.
2	#	No, no the full size.
2	#	You didnt say "junior".
2	#	He didnt seem too pleased.
2	#	hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.
2	#	I havent seen him for months.
2	#	I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
2	#	Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
2	#	Really?
2	#	Id love to go. Make an appointment.
2	#	I just got fired.
2	#	Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.
2	#	I knew it. I always felt different.
2	#	Drakes?
2	#	Did you buy this for me?
2	#	Ha, because I love Drakes Coffee Cake.
2	#	She hasnt eaten in two days.
2	#	Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.
2	#	When I hear her name mentioned.
2	#	There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.
2	#	Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?
2	#	Elaine.
2	#	Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
2	#	You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?
2	#	Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going to be.
2	#	Should I not go on this trip?
2	#	Elaine, what are you doing?
2	#	A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
2	#	If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane crash.
2	#	Not a plane crash. (leaving) Is it a plane crash?
2	#	People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.
2	#	Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres native unrest.
2	#	How come?
2	#	Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
2	#	No.
2	#	The psychic said something terrible will happen.
2	#	sweetheart, no come here,  sweetheart
2	#	how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.
2	#	Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..
2	#	I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.
2	#	Yeah, why? Why?
2	#	Because? Because?
2	#	Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
2	#	I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.
2	#	You wouldnt believe it. Rasputin.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	when did you get back?
2	#	So how was it?
2	#	Yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish.
2	#	Elle McPherson going to be there?
2	#	Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.
2	#	No, I won't.
2	#	I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.
2	#	No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
2	#	I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.
2	#	I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.
2	#	It's my only hope.
2	#	Out of the question. Out of the question!
2	#	No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?
2	#	How good looking?
2	#	Really good looking?
2	#	Would you take her out?
2	#	Oh, you hesitated.
2	#	No, something's off here, you hesitated.
2	#	What about the body, what kind of body?
2	#	How nice?
2	#	Just nice?
2	#	Really good?
2	#	What about personality?
2	#	Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.
2	#	Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?
2	#	What kind of hair?
2	#	Flowing?
2	#	Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.
2	#	Yeah, that's right.
2	#	Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?
2	#	I'd like to be able to get it out.
2	#	What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.
2	#	Is there a pinkish hue?
2	#	Yes, a rosy glow.
2	#	Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.
2	#	We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?
2	#	Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?
2	#	It's mellifluous!
2	#	She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.
2	#	Hey! Saturday night!
2	#	So, what did she say?
2	#	That's it?
2	#	She didn't mention anything about the conversation?
2	#	Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?
2	#	Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.
2	#	What are you gonna do with all of them?
2	#	I'll take one. It's possible.
2	#	Yeah, it's me, I just got home.
2	#	Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.
2	#	It's in the vault?
2	#	We had sex.
2	#	I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.
2	#	I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.
2	#	What are you gonna do?
2	#	I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.
2	#	No, don't call her.
2	#	No, Jerry, don't call.
2	#	I don't want you to call.
2	#	Give me the phone!
2	#	Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!
2	#	You can't do that, it's none of your business!
2	#	But tell him to give me the--
2	#	No.
2	#	What?
2	#	Defective?!
2	#	(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!
2	#	What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!
2	#	She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!
2	#	Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.
2	#	(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.
2	#	(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.
2	#	Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.
2	#	Oh I'm a chucker.
2	#	I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!
2	#	All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?
2	#	yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see anything. It was just a blur.
2	#	See ya.

2	#	Mine too.
2	#	You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...
2	#	But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think eventually an entire team would get wiped out.
2	#	Uh, it's only a matter of time.
2	#	Yes and I was hoping ... to get a thirteen week extension.
2	#	Well you know what I've discovered Mrs. Sokol. It's not so much the looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I am also looking. You can't discount looking. It's sort of a combination. It's looking, and listening, listening and looking. But you must look.

2	#	Let me see the watch.
2	#	You know we're living in a society!
2	#	Jerry. Jerry.
2	#	I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
2	#	One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking, like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead.
2	#	No.
2	#	How do you know?
2	#	We should take his limo.
2	#	Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till you see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's in Chicago.
2	#	Well the guy's just standing there.
2	#	We just go up to him, we say, "We're O'Brien."
2	#	No, he doesn't know O'Brien, if he knew O'Brien he wouldn't have a sign. Let's just do it.
2	#	What's gonna happen? They can't kill us.
2	#	I'll be O'Brien.
2	#	You're you.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	What, you don't want to be you?
2	#	Like who?
2	#	Well I like Dylan.

2	#	Clock over there. (to chauffer) O'Brien.
2	#	Sorry we're late.
2	#	Oh thank you.
2	#	Thank you very much. Dylan?
2	#	This is incredible! This is one of the greatest things I've ever done in my life! I'm gonna call my mother.
2	#	I dunno, I'm in a limo. (dials) Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!
2	#	Can he hear us?
2	#	I thought I saw him look in the mirror suspiciously.
2	#	Let's test him. Hey, driver. What do you say we stop off, pick up your sister, have a little fun back here? No, he can't hear us.
2	#	We'll ask him. (opens partition) My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?
2	#	Of course, the uh, the four passes. (closes partition) Four passes to Madison Square Garden? Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Of course! Chicago! The Knicks are playing the Bulls tonight!
2	#	We are going to the Knick game! Michael Jordan!
2	#	Did I tell you?! Did I tell you?!
2	#	You see, you see? I see things as they are and I say, 'no!' Uh, wait, you see things as they are not and you s- Wait, uh, you see things, do you see things as they are? What do you say when you see things?
2	#	If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?'
2	#	Where are we going? Why are we pulling off here?
2	#	We're on the Grand Central, there's no traffic.
2	#	Right. The other members of our party. (closes partition) Other members of our party? What other members of our party? I didn't even know we were in a party. Oh, I'm telling you, the jig is up.
2	#	It was a good jig.
2	#	There could be more than one O'Brien on a plane who ordered a limo.
2	#	Well you should have been O'Brien.
2	#	Yes, you have to be Murphy.
2	#	You're Murphy!
2	#	You're Murphy!! Look, let's just jump out of the car.
2	#	So we jump and roll, you won't get hurt.
2	#	We're slowing down. Are those the people?
2	#	Hello. I'm O'Brien.
2	#	So, um, you've read "The Big Game", have you?
2	#	Tell me your impressions, I would love to hear what a young woman thinks of "The Big Game".
2	#	Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.
2	#	Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.
2	#	Okay, I mean it's serious but--
2	#	Uh, my speech?
2	#	...and the Jews steal our money through their Zionist occupied government and use the black man to bring drugs into our oppressed white minority communities.
2	#	I said so many things.
2	#	They're shooting! They're shooting!
2	#	That's really very nice of you, Eva. Thank you.
2	#	Didja see the way she was looking at me?
2	#	I know, I know. Kind of a cute Nazi though.
2	#	I don't know.
2	#	I can't run, I have a bad hamstring.
2	#	I hurt it in a hotel room. You know where they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms? I can't sleep like that so I tried to kick it out and I pulled it.
2	#	For a mental patient. Wait a minute, the phone, we'll call the police.
2	#	9... 1... 1. She said she'd do anything. Hello, police? Uh, yeah listen, we're in the back of a limo in Queens--
2	#	--Astroturf? You know who's responsible for that, don't you?! The Jews! Ah, the Jews hate grass. They always have, they always will.
2	#	Would you excuse us for a minute Tim boy, we're kind of in the middle of something.
2	#	Tim, who's the head of the Aryan Union, you or me?
2	#	And who's responsible for making hate mongering and fascism popular again?
2	#	Good. I think you forgot something.
2	#	Good. Now get out.
2	#	Okay, what are we gonna do?
2	#	Alright, how's this? We wait till we get to your street corner, we see Elaine and Kramer then we get out. They can't shoot us in the city.
2	#	Me??
2	#	He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.
2	#	Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.
2	#	What do I do?! What do I do?!
2	#	I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien! I'm not O'Brien! Ask anyone! Jerry?! Jerry?!!
2	#	Boy! What a story! I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
2	#	I love when they touch your arm. I can't get enough of that. Why is that?
2	#	So you didn't turn her in?
2	#	Gonna see her again?
2	#	Hey, hey, hey! I dig.
2	#	Yes! I see enormous potential here.
2	#	Because great couples always have a great story about how they met. That's why I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never had a good meeting story.
2	#	I don't think so.
2	#	Oh, well I didn't know you went into Queens Jerry.
2	#	Tell her about the shoving.
2	#	No! Tell her.
2	#	You'll pay? I'm there.
2	#	Pass the salt please.
2	#	Bread.
2	#	God bless you.
2	#	I wasn't going to say anything, but then I could see that he wasn't going to open his mouth. (Chuckles)
2	#	Really, I was, I was only kidding around.
2	#	No, no, I don't think I'm special. My mother always said I'm not special.
2	#	I said 'God bless you'. Was that so wrong?
2	#	Yes, yes, I definitely waited. But let me say this Once he passes on that option, that 'God bless you' is up for grabs.
2	#	Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.
2	#	Oh ya, like there's something wrong with saying 'God bless you'. I was raised to say 'God bless you'.
2	#	Ah, shut up.
2	#	Who?
2	#	Why?!
2	#	Where's the remote phone?
2	#	God.
2	#	Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.
2	#	Maybe she just wants to talk to me?
2	#	Oh my God, an affair. That's so adult. It's like with stockings and martinis, and William Holden. On the other hand it probably wouldn't cost me any money.
2	#	I can't have an affair with a married woman, that's despicable!
2	#	Well, who is she?
2	#	Oh right, right! The blue sweatpants! Gees, it's too bad you can't say anything because of Angela.
2	#	You can't compromise your principles!
2	#	Can't live!
2	#	This country needs more people like you!
2	#	I believe strongly in that as you know.
2	#	That's why the world's in the shape it's in.
2	#	Oh my God. I must be crazy. What have I done?
2	#	What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I just committed adultery!
2	#	Oh yeah.
2	#	Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.
2	#	Well, that's a given.
2	#	Must be hell living in that house.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	No, why, what's happening?
2	#	Yeah, okay.
2	#	What?!
2	#	He mentioned my name?! What did he say?!
2	#	What? Why couldn't you think of something?!
2	#	You lie! How hard is it to lie?!
2	#	It's not my fault! I wasn't going to do anything until you got her all juiced up with your story about having the affair with the matador!
2	#	Oh don't-
2	#	She told this couple she had an affair with a matador.
2	#	Jerry, let's go! You ready?
2	#	Excuse me, I've got a maniac stalking me, I'm not staying in the city.
2	#	Come on let's get out of here.
2	#	Jerry, can we get out of here?!
2	#	(bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button fly! Why do they put buttons on a fly? It takes ten minutes to get these things open!
2	#	(incredulous) What?
2	#	Nothing.
2	#	I dont get art.
2	#	Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.
2	#	What for?
2	#	So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.
2	#	You know, I'm a little nervous.
2	#	Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel like I'm getting fixed up for a friendship.
2	#	Really? I thought you liked her.
2	#	You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, I'm not obligated to buy anything, am I?
2	#	(looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.
2	#	(gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.
2	#	I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
2	#	Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?
2	#	All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the dugout!
2	#	Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's not stopping! He just keeps going and going and going! (the usher abruptly stops at the second row) We're not in the first row?
2	#	She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
2	#	I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my feet up on the dugout!
2	#	Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) right there, that's better.
2	#	(amused) You're supposed to do that?
2	#	I'd rather go to a hanging.
2	#	Yeah?
2	#	Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--
2	#	--and this is Kramer.
2	#	Okay.
2	#	Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?
2	#	Just take the cap off.
2	#	Just take the cap off!
2	#	(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?
2	#	Okay, we'll go!
2	#	Five-hundred dollars?! What?
2	#	I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!
2	#	Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!
2	#	You weren't thinking.
2	#	Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?
2	#	I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.
2	#	Hey, Kramer.
2	#	What?
2	#	What's it say?
2	#	WOW!
2	#	(on intercom) It's George.
2	#	Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?
2	#	Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.
2	#	This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.
2	#	Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)
2	#	I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.
2	#	How 'bout Kramer.
2	#	(as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it! (he finally gets the remote away from them) Pinheads.
2	#	This is incredible!
2	#	Maybe I won't send her that check.
2	#	Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs)
2	#	So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?
2	#	Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.
2	#	Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.
2	#	I really think it looks good.
2	#	All bald people look good in hats.
2	#	What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.
2	#	No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.
2	#	Do you hear that?
2	#	You had to move the mirror?
2	#	I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.
2	#	I can't drive?
2	#	Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.
2	#	And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.
2	#	What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?
2	#	Alright, start looking for spaces.
2	#	Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.
2	#	I can't park in a garage.
2	#	I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.
2	#	You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.
2	#	(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?
2	#	Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.
2	#	There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!
2	#	No no no, he's not getting away with this.
2	#	Hey, what are you doing?
2	#	You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.
2	#	Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?
2	#	I was in the middle of a conversation.
2	#	The point is I was here first.
2	#	But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!
2	#	Are you gonna move the car?
2	#	Jerk!
2	#	Do you believe this guy?
2	#	I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.
2	#	Are you coming back down?
2	#	Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?
2	#	Oh, come on, you're good at this.
2	#	I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.
2	#	Hey!
2	#	Yeah, I'm fine.
2	#	What?
2	#	What, you know Jerry?
2	#	How do you know him?
2	#	Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.
2	#	What, you know Kramer?!
2	#	And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?
2	#	Oh great.
2	#	It's my space!
2	#	I'll die out here.
2	#	Oh, come on.
2	#	Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?
2	#	You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
2	#	You've got a prayer.
2	#	Did you talk to him?
2	#	You told him? What did you tell him?
2	#	I don't believe it, what did you say?
2	#	A pack of teenagers?
2	#	You are a genius, it's as simple as that.
2	#	Oh great.
2	#	Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.
2	#	Hey, who's talking to you?
2	#	What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?
2	#	Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.
2	#	Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.
2	#	Yeah, I'm sorry.
2	#	What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?
2	#	You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Uh huh.
2	#	Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.
2	#	I learned a lot about myself.
2	#	I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.
2	#	No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.
2	#	Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.
2	#	No no no, that's in the right position.
2	#	No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.
2	#	Do you?
2	#	Sid, it's completely his fault.
2	#	Don't do it!
2	#	Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.
2	#	No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.
2	#	So you're against me now?
2	#	He's right. never.
2	#	When do you ever have ten car lengths?
2	#	Oh please.
2	#	Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.
2	#	Well, thank you for your support.
2	#	Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.
2	#	Yeah, thanks.
2	#	No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.
2	#	No! Get out of here, Newman.
2	#	No, Newman, stop it.
2	#	I don't want him to!
2	#	You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!
2	#	Alright, just keep the hat!
2	#	I'm not going if he's going.
2	#	Officer, could I just explain something to you?
2	#	Officer, he can't pull in head first.
2	#	Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!
2	#	I don't have a job!
2	#	Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.
2	#	Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? Because Elaine has my keys.
2	#	I suppose I could.
2	#	Me?
2	#	Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. (The waitress comes over.)
2	#	Yearn? Do I yearn?
2	#	You yearn.
2	#	Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant craving...but I haven't yearned.
2	#	Aw, Kramer, don't start...
2	#	I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my life!
2	#	No.
2	#	No.
2	#	No.
2	#	No.
2	#	Uh...no.
2	#	No.
2	#	I like to get the Daily News!
2	#	Why?
2	#	Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.
2	#	"These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one line! You got fired!
2	#	Uh, no, I'm not.
2	#	You're not really gonna go to California, are you?
2	#	Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my keys, so I need mine back from you.
2	#	I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."
2	#	What for?
2	#	Jerry? Why?
2	#	So what?
2	#	Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.
2	#	What?
2	#	Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?
2	#	Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's apartment without his permission.
2	#	You never should have taken away his keys!
2	#	How'd the Mets do?
2	#	Yeah, coy.
2	#	Sure. (Turns around.)
2	#	No we're not.
2	#	Ask her about Kramer.
2	#	Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.
2	#	Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can I just let you in?
2	#	Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's keys.
2	#	Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
2	#	Nope, no can do.
2	#	Do you wanna fight?
2	#	I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! (The struggle continues.)
2	#	You're right, how did I miss that? (Begins unlocking the door, mutters under his breath) Maybe because it's a crock of shit.
2	#	Nothing.
2	#	Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
2	#	They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!
2	#	Well, what do they look like?
2	#	Well, they're obviously not here.
2	#	Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!
2	#	What?
2	#	What?
2	#	Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
2	#	Gimme half!
2	#	Why didn't she tell us?
2	#	We hardly read anything!
2	#	He forced me to!
2	#	Yes you did!
2	#	What, you don't want me to hold your keys?
2	#	Alright, alright, fine. (Gives the keys to Elaine.)
2	#	Whose are these?
2	#	Karen.
2	#	Great.
2	#	I think so.
2	#	I can't tell anymore.
2	#	Feel? What's that?
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Cleaning
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Yeah, yeah.
2	#	Tub is love?
2	#	Hah.
2	#	Yep. There's one liiiittle problem.
2	#	Yeeeaaah. (Jerry and George lean in to make their conversation a little more private) Well..... I've never really felt confident in uh..... one particular aspect.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.
2	#	You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.
2	#	It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
2	#	No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.
2	#	You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
2	#	Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.
2	#	Nothing.
2	#	Nobody's faking.
2	#	She's not faking!
2	#	I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?
2	#	You faked?
2	#	I think I'll have a piece of cake.
2	#	We got a chocolate malt in here!
2	#	I'm sure you are.
2	#	Maybe Karen is faking.
2	#	(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?
2	#	I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
2	#	Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)
2	#	So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?
2	#	Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
2	#	Yeah...(scratching his head) full.
2	#	It's Jerry's fault.
2	#	Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.
2	#	So you feel okay?
2	#	It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him 'Please wake up, do something.'
2	#	I hate him!
2	#	It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
2	#	Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?
2	#	Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?
2	#	All right, where do you want it?
2	#	All right I gotta get going.
2	#	I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.
2	#	I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
2	#	That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.
2	#	You see... All right I knew it.
2	#	I don't want any mango.
2	#	Very good. Juicy.
2	#	Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.
2	#	I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
2	#	I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.
2	#	I'm back, baby, I'm back!
2	#	Please, it's not necessary.
2	#	The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?
2	#	What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move)
2	#	You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.
2	#	Come on 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.
2	#	What?
2	#	But why?
2	#	I-I-I can't find my glasses.
2	#	I need to look for my glasses.
2	#	I can't believe this.
2	#	How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that.
2	#	How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
2	#	My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
2	#	(Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never went 'Ha!'
2	#	Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!
2	#	No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship.
2	#	I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.
2	#	(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet!
2	#	(Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.
2	#	(Annoyed) There's more.
2	#	Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!
2	#	(Muttering) No, that's it.
2	#	(Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're going?
2	#	Wha - what are you doing later?
2	#	Really?
2	#	Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?
2	#	(Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.
2	#	Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)
2	#	(Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service test.
2	#	Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.
2	#	To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do?
2	#	I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
2	#	I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!
2	#	(Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
2	#	(Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need some air..
2	#	(Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
2	#	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts picking up her things)
2	#	(Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..
2	#	It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..
2	#	What?
2	#	What about them?
2	#	They are?
2	#	Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')
2	#	Me neither!
2	#	I don't know.
2	#	This woman just set me up for a job!
2	#	What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. (Points to his own hand)
2	#	This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and (Makes a noise) I bop into this woman..
2	#	OH!!!! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?!
2	#	You coulda damaged my hand!
2	#	(Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. (Holds them out)
2	#	(Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts them on) I gotta get going.
2	#	(Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) Would you mind getting the door?
2	#	Thank you very much. (Walks out)
2	#	(Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory board.
2	#	(To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee table and hands them to George with the point facing him) Don't hand them to me with the point facing out!
2	#	You're sorry?!
2	#	(Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)
2	#	Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!.. Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum.
2	#	(Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)
2	#	Who was he?
2	#	(Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at them) What happened to him?
2	#	You mean, uh..?
2	#	(Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But how.. uh..?
2	#	(Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.
2	#	Like that?
2	#	That's it?
2	#	(Modest) Oh, thank you very much. (Chuckles)
2	#	(Quick, excited talking) Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! (Hands it to Jerry) They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting!
2	#	Alright. (Holds them up)
2	#	(Turning back to Jerry, he takes the check back. He just now notices the shirt Jerry's wearing, and snickers, pointing) Nice shirt.. (Laughs, Jerry shrugs) What is this? Is this what you wore on the show?
2	#	What, have you completely lost your mind?
2	#	Who's dressing you? (Laughs) You look like a complete idiot! You know, I wouldn't wipe my- (Unable to take anymore, Leslie gets up and shoves George violently. His hands go straight for the hot iron sitting on the dressing room table. George screams out in agony) AAHHHH!!!!! (his voice is heard outside the building, on the street, and in the park were a bunch of pigeons are scared by the yelling)
2	#	Ow! Hot! Hot!
2	#	(Reflecting on his life gone wrong) This McKigney guy had a few good years.. (To Kramer, bitter) How could you forget to turn off an iron?
2	#	My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt".
2	#	I gotta get out of this city.
2	#	I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?
2	#	I broke 'em playing basketball.
2	#	Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
2	#	When I find that guy, this much I vow those glasses will be returned to their rightful owner.
2	#	What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?
2	#	Yeah, come on.
2	#	Really?
2	#	Wow. Uh, what do I have to do?
2	#	That's it?
2	#	What about these?
2	#	Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.
2	#	Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?
2	#	Can you believe that guy?
2	#	He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little man. Well not this time! (George leaves the store and follows the dog owner) You! Dog man!
2	#	Uuh, no, no.
2	#	(In a really strange way) Good, good, do that.
2	#	Oh, no, nothing.
2	#	I can't tell you.
2	#	I can't tell you, don't ask.
2	#	I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.
2	#	They were right outside!
2	#	Yes!
2	#	Yes, positive.
2	#	I know! I was squinting.
2	#	(To the store owner) Excuse me, what do you think of these?
2	#	Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.
2	#	Yeah. (George hands over the prescription) Kramer...
2	#	Kramer...
2	#	You do know Kramer?
2	#	Well, I'm mentioning his name.
2	#	Because... you know...
2	#	Hey, I saw what I saw.
2	#	What side?
2	#	Ooh, so what?
2	#	Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?
2	#	There must be some way to find out.
2	#	What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!
2	#	I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? (snapping his fingers) I was spotting those raccoons.
2	#	(noticing something) Hey look, a dime.
2	#	Heh, Mercury head. You mind?
2	#	Did you get the shot?
2	#	You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
2	#	Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.
2	#	That's right, no discount!
2	#	Yes, I mentioned your name.
2	#	Pbbbs, Bubkis!
2	#	All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.
2	#	Yes it is.
2	#	I saw them making out, you can believe it.
2	#	(crying from the onion) You'll see I'm right.
2	#	Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.
2	#	I did!
2	#	Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
2	#	That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?
2	#	Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plan?
2	#	Madam? What are you calling me madam for?
2	#	He sold me ladies' glasses!
2	#	Ah, Oh boy.
2	#	Oh uuh, sure, why not. (the blind man hangs on to George's arm) Hey, that's the guy.
2	#	The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em! (George follows the man onto the street, dragging the blind man with him) Would you pick it up a little?
2	#	He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man) Those are nice glasses.
2	#	Is that right?
2	#	Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put his lenses in my frames and mine in his?
2	#	And I'd like a discount.
2	#	Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a whole refund. (trying to speak quietly) You gave me ladies' frames!
2	#	Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.
2	#	No, that's Jerry.
2	#	Yeah, 5A!
2	#	Boy, these really do pinch the nose.
2	#	Oh my God it is them.
2	#	Yeah. Hmm. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son of a bitch that stole my glasses...
2	#	So, what's wrong with him?
2	#	Well, I'm sure you'll find something.
2	#	What are those?
2	#	Wow, just felt your material?
2	#	Sounds like a cool guy.
2	#	Jerry, where did you get that sweater?
2	#	I think that's what the back of closets are for.
2	#	Who's that?
2	#	I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.
2	#	Yes, I saw that.
2	#	He was definitely sniffing.
2	#	All right, I gotta get going. My parents are expecting me.
2	#	This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could have as much as I want.
2	#	Next Friday, what time?
2	#	That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.
2	#	I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?
2	#	Do we have to...?
2	#	They are made from lycra-spandex.
2	#	She doesn't want to get a bra.
2	#	All right, it wouldn't kill me.
2	#	Yea I-I know about the cups.
2	#	I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on knowing that the D is the biggest.
2	#	I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. (puts the bra on the table)
2	#	Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much indeed, sir.
2	#	No, but um I have very good report with women, very good, comfortable. And from the first time I laid eyes on a brassieres, I was enthralled.
2	#	Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew I wanted to be around brassieres.
2	#	Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?
2	#	Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed sir.
2	#	If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.
2	#	So long, Mr. Farkus.
2	#	Oh, nothing...
2	#	So what, what is so bad about that?
2	#	What about that spot I got?
2	#	You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.
2	#	Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.
2	#	You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.
2	#	Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?
2	#	A pig-man?
2	#	(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?
2	#	Hey, there's a guy up the roof.
2	#	Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum...
2	#	My car! My caaaaarrrr!
2	#	Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.
2	#	I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.
2	#	I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"
2	#	But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?
2	#	Yeah. So how does that help me?
2	#	Yeah, my roommate in college.
2	#	(thinks for a second) I got used to it.
2	#	Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.
2	#	The pig-man can take the bus.
2	#	How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?
2	#	I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.
2	#	Well, I join them in their grief.
2	#	That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?
2	#	Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.
2	#	Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.
2	#	Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.
2	#	Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.
2	#	Yes.
2	#	Yes.
2	#	(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..
2	#	Should I leave this..?
2	#	So uh... been to a bris before?
2	#	I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)
2	#	Oh.
2	#	(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.
2	#	Alright, alright!
2	#	It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.
2	#	Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.
2	#	Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.
2	#	I have never seen a Mohel like that.
2	#	Wha, where is he going?
2	#	(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the "pig-man"?
2	#	No. And he's not a pig-man is he?
2	#	Where's the sunblock?
2	#	25? You don't have anything higher?
2	#	I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.
2	#	Yes, I have a problem with paba.
2	#	I know enough to stay away from it.
2	#	So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
2	#	Gwen really wants to go.
2	#	No good?
2	#	Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk to?
2	#	Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.
2	#	Who, the Croat? [the tennis player]
2	#	Yeah, she's a B.L.
2	#	Beautiful lineswoman. Alright listen uh I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some real sunblock. You want anything? Jerry? (Jerry is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?
2	#	Boy you are really smitten.
2	#	Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those guys.
2	#	They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the other side.
2	#	Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here on this side. Take me with you.
2	#	What are you going to say?
2	#	(laughing) You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"? You're not going to make it.
2	#	I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.
2	#	You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me" routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.
2	#	You're *damn* right it's me.
2	#	I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better than me.
2	#	Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find out.
2	#	Yeah so did I.
2	#	No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me" routine.
2	#	Yeah. Well aparently word's out.
2	#	Really? At the tennis match?
2	#	Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
2	#	Cracks? What were they saying?
2	#	Oh my god, maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
2	#	She must have seen me eating it on TV.
2	#	Why not. I would be.
2	#	You're parents saw me on TV?
2	#	This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
2	#	One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.
2	#	Can we move on?
2	#	Yes I do.
2	#	Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.
2	#	"To the victor goes the spoils." What are you going to do tonight?
2	#	Oh. (he stands there)
2	#	Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.
2	#	Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?
2	#	So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that concession stand cost me a relationship.
2	#	They're breaking up? How do you know?
2	#	What are they saying now?
2	#	(Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read Gwen's lips for me.
2	#	(Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen is saying about me.
2	#	(Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.
2	#	(Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case closed.
2	#	She confused "six" with "sex"?
2	#	Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex" then how is she going to lip read from across the room?
2	#	It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and "eh".
2	#	It seems like a problem.
2	#	Oh, when is that car service coming?
2	#	If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.
2	#	If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.
2	#	What?
2	#	ah.
2	#	Hey hey.
2	#	Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up with me?
2	#	Really?
2	#	I wouldn't hear of it, Todd. It's none of my business. But you should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll even stay all the way on the other side of the room just so there's no chance of me overhearing anything.
2	#	Hey, grown-up. (they both chuckle, George notices Gwen enter the room) Oh my god, there she is. Go ahead, go ahead. (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are they saying?
2	#	Wheret?
2	#	What?
2	#	Alright that's it. (George walks across the room over to them.) So you get rid of me and now the two of you are going to sleep together?
2	#	I heard your whole conversation.
2	#	(looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's sleep together.
2	#	Sweep?
2	#	Cut it.
2	#	Cut it.
2	#	Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop signing?
2	#	She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep together."
2	#	Ow. My eye, my eye.
2	#	Fantastic!
2	#	Good.
2	#	Very good.
2	#	Ya-see, how could this not have any fat? It's too good.
2	#	(offers his) Oh, you want to taste mine.
2	#	Lo..k, if you want to taste mine, you don't have to offer me some of yours.
2	#	What do you mean?
2	#	No kidding?
2	#	Oh, god. Look who's here.
2	#	This guy from my old neighborhood. Lloyd Braun. He's a big advisor to Mayor Dinkins. He thinks he's so cool.
2	#	Hey-hay! Lloyd! Hey! My friend Jerry eh.
2	#	Yeah, there was a fire in my apartment.
2	#	Uh, uh, yeah. Actually, the, uh, I-I bumped my elbow on a desk and uh injured something an.. now it sort of moves involuntarily.
2	#	Oh, pretty good.
2	#	Yeah, this is my first time here. (nudges Jerry again)
2	#	Uh, Elaine, this is, uh, Lloyd.
2	#	Yeah! Yeah.
2	#	He's a jerk. (nudges to his right but no one is there)
2	#	All right. All right.
2	#	No.
2	#	What's for supper?
2	#	Hey, Lloyd. (Shakes hands with Lloyd) How's it going? (chuckles)
2	#	Oh, it's good.
2	#	Nothing.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Well, it comes and goes.
2	#	You know, Lloyd, I-I've been to the doctor (hands George the card) there's really nothing they can do.
2	#	All right. All right! I'll go.
2	#	Oh, uh, just a friend of mine.
2	#	Oh, you know, Lloyd, I really don't have it.
2	#	Yeah!
2	#	So, he made an appointment for me to see Dinkins' doctor. He's just trying to humiliate me.
2	#	And I have to go. If I don't go, he'll know I'm lying.
2	#	I don't care. Look, Lloyd doesn't know what he's up against. This is nothing to me. (moving his arm) My whole life is a lie.
2	#	Hey
2	#	Oh, don't tell me. Lloyd?
2	#	Oh, look, he's going to ask you about my arm. So, just tell him I banged it against a desk. And it's been moving involuntarily ever since.
2	#	Why not?
2	#	So, you're taking his side?
2	#	Already you're marrying this guy?
2	#	All right, believe me, you're not going to marry him.
2	#	Yeah, yeah. Big advisor.
2	#	The next morning, I woke up, and it was going like this. (moves his arm slowly) I can control it if I really concentrate. But otherwise, (arm moves) oh.
2	#	Please, doctor.
2	#	Yes.
2	#	Uh-huh.
2	#	Hmm. Really? Nothing?
2	#	Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?
2	#	How so?
2	#	Faking? What makes you think that I have time to see doctors, take X-rays, make appointments, when there's absolutely nothing wrong with me? What kind of a person would do a thing like that?
2	#	Now, see here, doctor.
2	#	Fine. (hits his arm on the desk) Ow!
2	#	Name tags! Name tags! What kind of an idiot thinks anybody would be interested in an idea like that.
2	#	I banged it on the desk in the doctor's office. An (worriedly rubbing his arm) aaaa . . .
2	#	Phew!
2	#	Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
2	#	I enjoy understanding.
2	#	I want you to have this job. Of course...
2	#	That's it.
2	#	He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was the end of the interview.
2	#	Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check with my associates."
2	#	All right.
2	#	Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything immediately. That's what impressed him.
2	#	And if I don't call...
2	#	Rest stop supply.
2	#	Hey
2	#	I had a job interview.
2	#	Good. Of course...
2	#	He massacred you.
2	#	You look like you're five years old.
2	#	You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this relationship.
2	#	Well, you gotta do it.
2	#	So I still haven't heard about that job.
2	#	I have an idea.
2	#	I show up.
2	#	I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't have the job, by the time he comes back, I'm ensconced.
2	#	What's the worst thing that could happen?
2	#	Yeah, so?
2	#	(to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Hi nice to see you. How are you. Good morning. (to the secretary) Good morning.
2	#	The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. I was wondering if you could tell me where my office is.
2	#	Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.
2	#	Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start his vacation.
2	#	Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just take the small office.
2	#	Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love to be nestled.
2	#	Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait to sink my teeth into that. Wow that Pensky. Well we'll straighten him out.
2	#	They gave me the Pensky file.
2	#	You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers are really taking to me.
2	#	(continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.
2	#	He'll be back on Monday.
2	#	You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.
2	#	Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?
2	#	Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring the contents of the file into this flexible accordion-style folder.
2	#	He's on vacation.
2	#	Well you know in college they used to call me the little bulldog.
2	#	Really?
2	#	Not now Florice.
2	#	I am aware. I am aware.
2	#	Mr. Tuttle, you're back.
2	#	You are?
2	#	Oh. Really.
2	#	Ah, here it is.
2	#	Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
2	#	Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
2	#	You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
2	#	(chuckles) Really? Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.
2	#	Obviously.
2	#	(George is telling a story. Karen is laughing and she seems to be the only one to find him funny) So I go into this clothing store and the saleswoman is wearing this (whistling) low cut thing. So I said to her "Can I ask you a question? When you put on a top like that, what's your tought process? What's going on in your mind?"
2	#	(to Jody) You're listening to this?
2	#	Well nothing. I didn't actually say that. (Karen is still laughing)
2	#	Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.
2	#	You know it's like you never see a really attractive woman getting a traffic ticket.
2	#	Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. (to the waitress) Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.
2	#	Jody let's do this agian real soon (he tends his arms for a hug but she avoids him)
2	#	So, what do you think?
2	#	Jody's nice.
2	#	You think she liked me? She seemed to like me.
2	#	I was personable. Don't you think I was personable?
2	#	I tought I picked up a little something. I'm very good at this. Did you pick up anything?
2	#	The second time I sent the noodles back, I tought she made a face...
2	#	I tought I saw a face.
2	#	No difference. I could care less. She's Jerry's girlfriend.
2	#	He he he he
2	#	So you think she likes me?
2	#	She stayed over?
2	#	The sex wasn't so good?
2	#	So?
2	#	Did you ask her?
2	#	Why not?
2	#	So we had a good time... the four of us.
2	#	We all got along. Everyone seemed very pleasant.
2	#	What did Jodi say?
2	#	Is that it?
2	#	Did she say anything about, uh...
2	#	Nah. It's all right. Great! She had a good time.
2	#	You just hesitated.
2	#	She didn't like me?
2	#	So she doesn't like me?
2	#	She said that?
2	#	She told you she doesn't like me!
2	#	What were her exact--
2	#	Uh-Huh (gulp) Why didn't she like me?
2	#	I tried to be nice. I wasn't nice?
2	#	I bent over backwards for that woman! Is it that thing I said about her sister?
2	#	I don't even know her sister but believe me, if she's getting traffic tickets, she's not that good-looking! Woah
2	#	You vomited in 1987.
2	#	Ha! Ha! Hey! (moving his arms like it's so great to be all here)
2	#	Here. Let me take your tabe downstairs for you.
2	#	Please give it to me. I love to help people. This is what I do. Come on. I'm going this way. (he takes the table from Jodi's hands and she has no choice but to follow him)
2	#	No one hails a cab like me. My hailing technique is unmatched. I get the wrist going from side to side and boom! Cabs are crashing into themselves to just pick me up. (a cab stops) All right, here we go. Let me get door. Feminists aside, I know women like the door holding. Here we are all righty. O.K. Jodi let's get together again real soon and say hello to your sister for me.
2	#	Whatever. Believe me, if I wasn't involved right now, I wouldn't mind being set up. Something tells me she's a knockout. (we see, from the camera inside the cab, George's hand waving as the cab drives away)
2	#	So I lugged that table. That big heavy massage table all the way down to the cab! You ever seen one of those things?
2	#	No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.
2	#	Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!
2	#	I wanna know what I did to this woman.
2	#	No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.
2	#	Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!
2	#	You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.
2	#	I think I can still catch her.
2	#	What? What are you talking about.
2	#	I know. I know.
2	#	(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)
2	#	That I'm used to. (he leaves)
2	#	Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
2	#	We need to talk.
2	#	Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.
2	#	(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.
2	#	She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.
2	#	A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.
2	#	I got to go after her.
2	#	JODI! (he starts running after her)
2	#	Wha... you're going?
2	#	Wha? Did you use those? These are guest soaps! (he grabs the soaps and begins examining them for damage)
2	#	Now my parents are gonna know I had people over.
2	#	I can't have any parties while they're out of town. (he leaves to return the soaps)
2	#	(yells) Wow! Who put this cup right on the new table!
2	#	But you didn't use a coaster, Jerry, you left a stain! (he runs to kitchen)
2	#	(screaming) Aaahh!!
2	#	But Jerry, this is not coming out!
2	#	My parents don't read! They're gonna wonder what a book is doing on the table!
2	#	Wait, wait wait, not so fast. Jerry, you gotta take me to get this thing refinished.
2	#	Yes, now. It's gonna take a few days and my parents are gonna be back. I gotta have it back before them!
2	#	Alright, Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.
2	#	Why?
2	#	Can't hurt you.
2	#	The Indian?
2	#	Alright, but no later, because my parents are coming back.
2	#	No, it's, it's his. (indicates Jerry)
2	#	Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.
2	#	(sensing his chance) Well, they do now. Neighborhood's changing.
2	#	Well, we're collectors. We, uh, see objects of great beauty and, uh, we must have them.
2	#	(proffering glasses) I hope prune juice is alright. It's the only thing I had that was chilled.
2	#	I'm sorry about that lock on the liquor cabinet. The combination musta just flown outta my head. It's a mental block.
2	#	(bashful) No, that's me.
2	#	Yes, it is consistent. I've, uh, I've tried to maintain a consistent feel throughout the house.
2	#	The Ray Conniff Singers. (nervous chuckle)
2	#	It's a pot pourri. May I, uh, may I show you the master bedroom? (they leave together)
2	#	Looks pretty good.
2	#	Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.
2	#	So, anyway, what's uh, what's the status with, uh...
2	#	Oh, great.
2	#	Aw c'mon.
2	#	(insincerely) Ahh, hey you're home. Hi.
2	#	Yeah, huh.
2	#	So, how was the trip?
2	#	What TV Guide?
2	#	I didn't know she took it!
2	#	(to Jerry) He collects them.
2	#	I don't know, uh...
2	#	Yes!
2	#	(pleading) Well, my bed is too small.
2	#	What are you talking about?
2	#	Of course you can.
2	#	(incredulous) You can't ground me, I'm a grown man.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is unbelievable. (looks at the menu) Ooh, a little expensive.
2	#	Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. You know youre the only woman Ive never thought about the price. Get the lobster. I beg you to get the lobster. Go for the lobster.
2	#	We do?
2	#	Why?
2	#	Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster isnt the way to go.
2	#	Its over.
2	#	Kramer.
2	#	Lobster.
2	#	She says we cant go out anymore.
2	#	Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont let her get involved with anyone who isnt Latvian Orthodox.
2	#	I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats not entirely true.
2	#	She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at home. Didnt seem to bother her. I think I could have married this woman.
2	#	I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, in the cab on the way over here, I actually thought about converting.
2	#	Why not? What do I care?
2	#	Really?
2	#	King Edward. (snapping his fingers) King Edward, Jerry.
2	#	You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the difference.
2	#	No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise her.
2	#	How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, you have a ceremony. I am going to think about this. I am really going to think about this.
2	#	(ahem) In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man begins to ask himself certain questions. How can one even begin to put into words something so um (trying to think of a word)
2	#	No.
2	#	No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")
2	#	Yes.
2	#	(he thinks) I think the hats. The hat conveys that solemn religious look you want in a faith. Very pious.
2	#	Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.
2	#	Yes. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and the commandments and all that.
2	#	Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, am I in?
2	#	Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious to become a member. Um, dont you offer any kind of an express conversion? A quick change?
2	#	Nice nun.
2	#	I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually Orthodox. All I have to do is read a few books, memorize a few prayers, and Im in the club.
2	#	Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will be Brother Costanza.
2	#	Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
2	#	Kramer, they like everybody. Theyre friendly people.
2	#	Story.
2	#	Yea, she likes you.
2	#	So?
2	#	Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?
2	#	Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
2	#	People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
2	#	I still have brill cream.
2	#	What? Nothing.
2	#	Im fine.
2	#	Nothing.
2	#	No.
2	#	No!
2	#	I dont know. I cant believe theyre making me take this test.
2	#	What does it look like Im doing?
2	#	Oh, Im Im full of it Father.
2	#	Oh, I understand. (George exits; Sees Kramer in the hallway) Hey.
2	#	For a woman.
2	#	No its a regular religion.
2	#	I dont want to get out of it.
2	#	No no.
2	#	Yes faddah.
2	#	What?
2	#	I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.
2	#	Well I didnt do it for my mother.
2	#	Latvia?
2	#	Enjoy, enjoy.
2	#	Id like a doggie bag for this please. (hands her plate to the waitress)
2	#	"step off"?
2	#	you said "step off"? wow, that is too much hey..huh hey (George turns the cap his wearing backwards like Tony) Tony, I huh, I just had this brainstorm for us. Can you guess what it is?

2	#	Oh no, I am down!
2	#	alright alright
2	#	yeah that's right. I like it. He's such a cool guy
2	#	he's the first cool guy I've ever been friends with in my whole life. You know.. it's a different world when you're with a cool guy, he's not afraid of anybody. You should hear the way he talks to waitresses.. he gets free pie!
2	#	hey nice move today
2	#	horning on my rock climbing trip. It's just supposed to be me and Tony
2	#	you put him on the spot

2	#	you better be careful on those rocks tomorrow buddy. And you're not getting any sandwiches either
2	#	well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there
2	#	Hey Elaine, does Tony like peanut butter?

2	#	she's there, I can hear her
2	#	huh you tell her
2	#	if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen (back on Jerry and Elaine's side, we can hear George saying "I was the one who was invited", Jerry opens the door)
2	#	what are you doing here?
2	#	oh..
2	#	Kramer was supposed to tie a knot
2	#	Well, Tony.. took a bit of a tumble
2	#	he..he's alive
2	#	Well you see he slipped, and he landed on a kinda of a..
2	#	yeah.. the ambulance got there very quickly
2	#	we rode along all the way to the hospital
2	#	Hi Elaine
2	#	I just wanted to talk to Tony for a minute (hands Elaine some stuff)
2	#	me? "step off"
2	#	but..why, it wasn't my fault, I .. you asked me a sandwich, I .. I make such delicious sandwiches Elaine
2	#	here Elaine here, Superman (hands a comic book to Elaine, who passes it to Tony) please, next time it will only be the two of us
2	#	oh Tony don't
2	#	I I just.. but..
2	#	yes?
2	#	What?
2	#	This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. You know about Gore-Tex?
2	#	All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.
2	#	What for?
2	#	Why?
2	#	You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?
2	#	So you're telling me instead of them being happy to see me, they're going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. Ttst --You see what I'm saying?
2	#	I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
2	#	Why not?
2	#	You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh (snort), no way wine is better than Pepsi.
2	#	I just don't like the idea that any time theres a dinner invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.
2	#	Hehehehehe (higher tone laugh, though still quietly )
2	#	Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.
2	#	Oh, here we go...
2	#	Why don't we get them a couch? (Kramer laughs) Well rent a U-haul -- well bring em a nice sectional.
2	#	Why don't you just get some Ring Dings from the liquor store?
2	#	Hey, Ring Dings are better than anything you're gonna get at a bakery.
2	#	(to Kramer) It's a funeral procession. . . . (to Elaine) And I got news for you. I show up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit of the party. People be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. What are we, Europeans with the Beaujolais and Chardonnay . . .
2	#	Ah, Just double park.
2	#	Why not?
2	#	Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give em up.
2	#	All right, I'll tell you what... why don't you go into the store and I'll wait in the car?
2	#	Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get cold.
2	#	Does the heater even work in this car?
2	#	Oh, Hey, eh, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see
2	#	You see, hu, ho ho.
2	#	Alright, what are we getting? It's hot in here!
2	#	What's that?
2	#	Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee you theyre not getting no twelve dollar cake.
2	#	. . . Why not?
2	#	"throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money? (pulls out his wallet)
2	#	So what do you do?
2	#	All right here you go.
2	#	You can't - huhu, All right let's go.
2	#	Are you crazy?! What are you doing?! You'll get us killed!
2	#	Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be jumping out of windows on top of us.
2	#	I am not buying something just to get change.
2	#	All right, what are we doing?
2	#	Pack of gum. Here you go. (hands the clerk a $100 bill)
2	#	Why not?
2	#	Newspaper.
2	#	Clark Bar.
2	#	Were up to two dollars here.
2	#	I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
2	#	Oh, that's nice.
2	#	It's not real. They're all made up.
2	#	Well you know there is an unusual number of people in this country having sex with AMPUTEES! (grabs the forum from Kramer and walks over to the clerk) . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark Bar.
2	#	Ah, great. All right, with the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.
2	#	Yes, Im Sorry, it's a new coat. It-it's Gore-Tex.
2	#	All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Whoopee Whoa! Imagine if we didn't bring the wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S YOUR WINE? GET OUT!
2	#	L-Look at this?
2	#	Somebody double parked and blocked us in. D-DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. Ohh-oh brother. No, no note. Can you believe this?
2	#	I really can not comprehend how stupid people could be sometimes. Can you comprehend it?
2	#	I mean we can put a man on the moon but we're still basically very stupid. The guy who's car this is? He could be one of the guys that built the rocket. You see what I'm saying?
2	#	So you really understand my point about building a rocket and double-parking.
2	#	Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard for basic human decency. Yeah this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini would circle the block six times looking for a spot?
2	#	Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the death penalty for double-parkers. If this is allowed to go on this is not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!
2	#	No not really.
2	#	I know that's why I bought `em but they're not comfortable.
2	#	We are really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
2	#	You know -- Elaine.
2	#	. . . I'm a little scared of her.
2	#	Yes!
2	#	Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late cause I bought a Panama hat -- she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard my head came right through the top of it.
2	#	Why didn't you just wear a heavier coat?
2	#	Oh, Hey, hey, hey! That's great! That's very nice. You know we've been waiting twenty minutes for you people?! What do you think, you're Mussolini?!
2	#	I wasn't talking to you.
2	#	Do you think chickens have individual personalities?
2	#	If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities Im not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?
2	#	Oh, no no no -- We bought the wine here before, but now, you know we're bl-blocked in by some car double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.
2	#	But my friend here has hypothermia.
2	#	You know that coat was Gore-Tex. Its worth a hell of a lot more than that, cheap Chardonnay.
2	#	I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.
2	#	Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein. The dictator.
2	#	S-s-somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He eh, had a British accent though.
2	#	What, what happened to you?
2	#	I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
2	#	I spilled some Chardonnay. So, what did you get?
2	#	Cinnamon? Why didn't cha get chocolate?
2	#	And your wine.
2	#	You can't handle the truth! (he salutes) (imitating Jack Nicholson [a.k.a. Col. Nathan R. Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)
2	#	(still in Jacks voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! (he salutes)
2	#	Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	No, anything.
2	#	She'll open!
2	#	Yes.
2	#	I was curious! (imitating his moms voice)
2	#	Maybe I can get her locked up.
2	#	Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night?
2	#	I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish!
2	#	Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?
2	#	Hey.
2	#	I do.
2	#	I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.
2	#	Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?
2	#	Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper.
2	#	Keep your head down.
2	#	Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn!
2	#	Ahh! How'd she look?
2	#	Ahh! (closes his eyes and rolling his head back) Umh!
2	#	She asked about me? What did- What did she say?
2	#	George! She said George? She remembered my name. (loudly -- to a passing waitress and the rest of the restaurant) Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!
2	#	(pauses for a few seconds) OK, I'm tellin' you right now - if your kiddin' around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that.
2	#	Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game we're finished!
2	#	Oh my god he's not kidding. (exhale gasp)
2	#	A what?
2	#	(pauses) A marine biologist?
2	#	Why am I a marine biologist?
2	#	But I'm not a marine biologist!
2	#	So?
2	#	I didn't even know it was a job.
2	#	Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table)
2	#	Algae, obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.
2	#	I dont know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.
2	#	Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.
2	#	Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.
2	#	How'd she find it?
2	#	Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.
2	#	Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.
2	#	But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)
2	#	Oh, they're busting!
2	#	So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment  I was a Marine Biologist!
2	#	I know I was just telling them the story.
2	#	The sea was angry that day my friends like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!
2	#	I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!
2	#	Whatever.
2	#	Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!
2	#	(Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)
2	#	Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me
2	#	kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.
2	#	Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home.
2	#	Sand. It's everywhere
2	#	Did she say why?
2	#	Maybe she's diabetic.
2	#	Maybe you said something that offended her.
2	#	Like at the airport? (getting excited)
2	#	That's a great idea!!!
2	#	We could be zipping all over the place.
2	#	They never try anything.
2	#	No harm!
2	#	Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing?
2	#	Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?
2	#	Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits in there?
2	#	I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking me out to lunch on Friday.
2	#	All right. All right. (They both leave)
2	#	It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. Don't fall asleep Elaine.
2	#	Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?
2	#	You think so?
2	#	You really think this looks O.K. on me?
2	#	Ah, Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) Is this the price tag?
2	#	Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit)
2	#	So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?
2	#	Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)
2	#	(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?
2	#	No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)
2	#	(leaving the european accent) No. (laughs)
2	#	Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.
2	#	Yea Yea Yea
2	#	Yes. Now take off those pants.
2	#	(to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it.
2	#	Why didn't you just tell her?
2	#	How could he not have washed?
2	#	Yeah, just like I do.
2	#	Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?
2	#	Olive?
2	#	Oh.
2	#	I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty minutes.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	The last time I saw her, she was naked.
2	#	(George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.
2	#	Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, I do believe I shall purchase it.
2	#	Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.
2	#	You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?
2	#	I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!
2	#	This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.
2	#	Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?
2	#	No, I didn't hear anything.
2	#	No, can't say as I did.
2	#	Could be the leaves...
2	#	I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.
2	#	No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.
2	#	Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant it's Bob!)
2	#	No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently ill.
2	#	What happened to your itch?
2	#	Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?
2	#	It's just not good, it's not good.
2	#	I'm bored. She's boring, I'm boring, we're both boring. We got out to eat, we both read newspapers.
2	#	No. Lunch we read, dinner we read.
2	#	Ya
2	#	There's nothing to talk about.
2	#	Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.
2	#	She knows there is nothing to talk about.
2	#	Oh shut up.
2	#	Hey, Al. How's it going?
2	#	Oh I'm seeing someone, yes. You know her, Daphne Bower.
2	#	We have no need to speak. We communicate with deep soulful looks.
2	#	What about me?
2	#	Ya
2	#	Deeply in love. If you can't say anything bad about a relationship, you shouldn't say anything at all.
2	#	I didn't even know Fulton was in the hospital.
2	#	Na no, I'm not good in these situations. I can't hide my pity. I..I make em feel worse.
2	#	Ya and also I'm afraid that people in that state are finally going to tell me what they really think of me. You know they got nothing to lose what do they care?
2	#	No but say hello for me.
2	#	Hi, nice to meet you.
2	#	(to Kramer) You got a job?
2	#	(to Mickey) Can't you just switch with another Midget?
2	#	Yap..
2	#	(sets down his paper) So how were the eggs?
2	#	(Not amused with her answer) Eggs are eggs. That is very profound. (laughs; Daphne goes back to reading her paper) By the same token you could say fish is fish. Ha ha ha, I don't think so. (pauses) Listen Dophne
2	#	Daphne. I have to tell you something, this is very difficult...
2	#	Ya, ya. I bumped into him on the bus. What did he have to say?
2	#	What?
2	#	He said that? (Daphne shacks her head) What a nerve. How dare he say something like that.
2	#	Of course not. I mean sure, there may have been one or two occasions in the past, when I may have reacted in uh impulsive or somewhat immature manner, but those days are well behind me.
2	#	(on the speaker) Ya
2	#	This you are not going to believe. Al Netchie, that pimple. Tells Daphne, not get this 'Not to get involved with me.'
2	#	Ya. That's what she told me.
2	#	Because he's afraid she's gonna get hurt.
2	#	Of course.
2	#	Wa.. He doesn't have to tell her.
2	#	Oh no no no. He's deeply in love, and I was just about to break up with her when she told me.
2	#	Well I can't break up with her now.
2	#	Because he said I was going to.
2	#	Yes, I am.
2	#	I don't see any way around it.
2	#	What choice do I have?
2	#	(interrupts her) You know what. I don't think I'm going to be able to stay over tonight.
2	#	I, I really should go home. Ya.. actually I'm planning on spending the day with my father tomorrow (short laugh) we're uh we're going to a father-son picnic, just the two of us.
2	#	Well Dad's been planning this for such a long time, he bought a new blanket, and he got tha...that game with foam paddles and the velcro ball. (laughs)
2	#	Yes, oh yes very much.
2	#	No, no I do. You know it's just...
2	#	(angry that she believes Al was right) No he's not right. Al Netchie is not right! Alright I'm canceling the father-son picnic. I don't know what he's gonna do with all that potato salad.
2	#	So she's just sitting there, she's having a pleasant conversation... and all of a sudden.
2	#	It.
2	#	Out. (Jerry shakes his head in agreement) Wow. I spend so much time trying to get their clothes off, I never thought of taking mine off. (Jerry nods; George looks at his watch) Alright, Hey come on, get out of here, Dophne gonna be here any minute.
2	#	You know what I've come to realize? I'm not just bored. I genuinely dislike her.
2	#	Hey I'll get married if I have to. Al Netchie will think twice before he opens his mouth about me again.
2	#	I'm very disappointed to here you talk like that. You still don't know what makes me tick.
2	#	What are you doing?
2	#	(happily) Difficult?
2	#	(acting disappointed) Oh, please don't.
2	#	Packyderm?
2	#	Can I come upstairs, please? (Elaine pushes the button and lets George in.)
2	#	Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.
2	#	Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave me a dirty look.
2	#	Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! (Kramer enters with his quilt.)
2	#	Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?
2	#	Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.
2	#	Medical journals!
2	#	They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
2	#	Talk to him!
2	#	You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
2	#	Well, that doesn't mean anything!
2	#	Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?
2	#	Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?
2	#	Why?
2	#	Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!
2	#	Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!
2	#	I was there! I saw a drain!
2	#	It's all pipes! What's the difference?!
2	#	I'll call a plumber right now! (Goes for the phone.)
2	#	What happened? Did he bring it up?
2	#	Signal? What signal?
2	#	I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. Now I got him! And you're my witness!
2	#	A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?
2	#	What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning me in, that I got the goods on him!
2	#	So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
2	#	Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
2	#	When are they leaving for Paris?
2	#	What about her place?
2	#	Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a cool thing, living with your parents.
2	#	Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?
2	#	Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over dinner before they leave town.
2	#	Hey Alec
2	#	Hey Joey, how you doin'?
2	#	Well uh....
2	#	Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.
2	#	What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
2	#	Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now they do it right after single Jeopardy.
2	#	Oh, n-no comparison.
2	#	(stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
2	#	Your parents are going to Paris right?
2	#	So I tell Alec that I have to go to Paris for an undetermined amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have your parents mail them from Paris.
2	#	Who?
2	#	I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 'em in any mailbox.
2	#	Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll reimburse you of course.
2	#	Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in the attic, y-you think they're worth something?
2	#	What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in the clothing in then?
2	#	(pondering) Yes I suppose they do.
2	#	(grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What about tonight?
2	#	Yea they're making Paella.
2	#	Well um, what about tomorrow night?
2	#	Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.
2	#	(quietly) Ya.
2	#	Ya.
2	#	No, they had plans.
2	#	That's what I wanna know.
2	#	They said tomorrow, maybe.
2	#	I don't know what the reason could be.
2	#	Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.
2	#	Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be away for.
2	#	An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.
2	#	Fantastic?
2	#	How gee what a coincidence.
2	#	I dunno they said maybe.
2	#	Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.
2	#	I-I wasn't in the attic.
2	#	Maybe it was a mouse.
2	#	What?
2	#	You haven't even seen one.
2	#	I guess I've been hanging on to them for so long cuz i couldn't accept the fact that Dad was really gone forever (hugs a piece of clothing)
2	#	They will get a good home won't they?
2	#	Oh I beg to differ. My father took great pride in his appearance, he was a very handsome man, a casanova really.
2	#	Could you make it two-twenty-five that was his hi-game in bowling.
2	#	Thank you.
2	#	Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's what he would have wanted.
2	#	(leaving) That'll do.
2	#	Hey that's swell.
2	#	Dinner? (grabs Kramer)
2	#	You had dinner with the Seinfelds'?
2	#	Was this something you had planned for a while?
2	#	(hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, They had plans!
2	#	Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans huh? They were busy. They were busy with their (doing a little dance to make the plans seem all that important) big plans!
2	#	Mom and Pop Seinfeld
2	#	Alright I happen to know what they did last night, they had dinner with Kramer.
2	#	So what's the deal they don't want to have dinner with my parents?
2	#	Is there something wrong with my parents?
2	#	Because my parents happen to be two pretty wonderful people.
2	#	Yes.
2	#	So are they coming tonight or not?
2	#	Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, very interesting if they don't show up tonight. You know my mother made all this Paella.
2	#	It's a spanish dish. It's a moulage of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
2	#	Hey could you do one other thing for me?
2	#	You think your parents would have any objections to taking a little kid to Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him confused) It turns out that the kid's father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is that a coincidence? (Jerry smilies) Eh you know Alec wants me to take him over there so I figure as long as they're going (claps)
2	#	(pause) Alright if you think it's too much they don't have to mail the postcards.
2	#	They were drinking champaign in a buggy!
2	#	Yea
2	#	(in the threshold between the living room and the kitchen) The thing that bothers me the most, is the lying.
2	#	(sitting down) Vacation?
2	#	(claps all happy) AH! (half hugs Estelle)
2	#	The attic? Y-you haven't wore any of those clothes for years.
2	#	(picking up what Frank saw as a mouse) It's the remote.
2	#	I'm trying to buy some of the clothes back. (realizing something) Hey you wanna come over for dinner tonight? My mother made all this extra Paella.
2	#	Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good for us. I shouldn't say anything bad about your uh your partner.
2	#	Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.
2	#	You're doing all the leg work.
2	#	He's ripping you off
2	#	If anybody should be getting more it's you.
2	#	Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.
2	#	I'm sorry, umm he-here's your money back (gives Rudy the money back) I-I-I'll have the clothes.
2	#	So uh where are the clothes?
2	#	Oh. That's good.
2	#	Moths?
2	#	Well you know what happens with larvae hatch, they-they're everywhere.
2	#	Hey uh let me take you're coat.
2	#	Dad?!
2	#	Rudy?! That skunk, I knew he didn't burn those clothes.
2	#	I sold your clothes yesterday.
2	#	I didn't think you wore them anymore.
2	#	Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter flight?
2	#	What happens to charter tickets when you don't use em?
2	#	Yes I suppose they are.
2	#	Yes.
2	#	Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I mail my own postcards.
2	#	It's alright, I got lunch.
2	#	Honesty, hard-work, these are the values that I was raised on. The most important thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself in the mirror before you go to sleep at night.
2	#	Where the hell is your father?!
2	#	Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat that! That's not food! (to Robin) He's suckin' down Equal packets!
2	#	25 kids for his birthday party? (to kid under table) Don't put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, here, have some more sugar packets. (tosses some Equal packets under the table)
2	#	How about Bozo?
2	#	Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none.
2	#	With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...
2	#	He had a TV show! He had cartoons!
2	#	You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday parties w-with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday party...
2	#	Nah, I have asthma. (Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under the table, and George struggles.)
2	#	Bozo?
2	#	B-O-Z-O?
2	#	You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
2	#	How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
2	#	How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
2	#	Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?
2	#	Yes, he's a clown!
2	#	Alright, just forget it.
2	#	Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, Eric. Eric! (chuckles) What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?
2	#	Well, I do what I can. (Robin comes over.)
2	#	Ah, great, great. (sniffs) What's that smell? Smoke? (walks to the kitchen) Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...(smoke boils into the doorway.) FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!
2	#	Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where-where heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?
2	#	Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that exit was clear. Any other questions?
2	#	Its not easy.
2	#	So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
2	#	No, her too. And her mother.
2	#	Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.
2	#	Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
2	#	To some degree.
2	#	In a manner of speaking.
2	#	Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like equals.
2	#	Perhaps.
2	#	Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
2	#	What's that?
2	#	Wow, he really does a number on you. (reads) "Seinfeld froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."
2	#	You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and heckle her.
2	#	You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'
2	#	I'm not kidding, you should do it.
2	#	Well, go ahead! Do it!
2	#	No reason!
2	#	This is unprecedented!
2	#	What...are you using my babies now?
2	#	What accident?
2	#	That's unbelievable!
2	#	Wha.. you ran?
2	#	Holy cow!
2	#	How could you do that?!
2	#	You're Batman.
2	#	Well, wha-what about the toe? What happened to the toe?
2	#	You did all this...for a pinky toe?
2	#	Robin? Robin!
2	#	Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.
2	#	O.k....(is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.)
2	#	...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give me one more chance.
2	#	Alright, but I'm serious about this.
2	#	The prop comic? (Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.) Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?
2	#	I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
2	#	You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) It's amazing. If I reach out and touch her breast right not, she'd scream and throw me out of the car. But at this time tomorrow, I could touch it all I want.
2	#	Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?
2	#	Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining a private club. I'll be the same me tomorrow, but suddenly, the no trespassing sign will be gone.
2	#	Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.
2	#	My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton tomatoes.
2	#	(To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar and fifty cents in change on the bottom of the pool.
2	#	Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You wanna go for a ride?
2	#	Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?
2	#	Hey Rachel!
2	#	What kind of a greeting was that?
2	#	Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em like apples. You know it's funny, the tomato never really took on as a hand fruit.
2	#	Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)
2	#	This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster for dinner...
2	#	You saw who, what?
2	#	You saw Jane topless?
2	#	Oh you mean face down on her chest.
2	#	Face up on her back?
2	#	Well why'd she do that?
2	#	You mean she just laid there topless?
2	#	Walked around? And you looked?
2	#	I can't believe that you saw her before me.
2	#	Well, how good a look did you get?
2	#	Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...
2	#	Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.
2	#	Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't like this situation, Jerry. I don't like it one bit.
2	#	Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime.
2	#	It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of Tang and you jump out first.
2	#	Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their room and goes in)
2	#	Oh, sorry.
2	#	I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've never seen before.
2	#	I didn't.
2	#	No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.
2	#	Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.
2	#	Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits)
2	#	(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
2	#	Did she do it on purpose?
2	#	I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
2	#	Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
2	#	Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...
2	#	Yes. Significant shrinkage.
2	#	Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete misapprehension. That was not me, Jerry. That was not me.
2	#	What if she discusses it with Jane?
2	#	How do you know?
2	#	They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?
2	#	How do women know about shrinkage?
2	#	Do women know about shrinkage?
2	#	No.
2	#	It just does.
2	#	See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.
2	#	What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?
2	#	You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?
2	#	You're going back to New York now?
2	#	Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.
2	#	And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
2	#	*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!
2	#	Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.
2	#	Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.
2	#	A little breakfast.
2	#	(To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?
2	#	Ah, enjoying them?
2	#	Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with one of these. (Holds up lobster bib)
2	#	Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.
2	#	Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize.
2	#	I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.
2	#	Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some more.
2	#	Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
2	#	I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks)
2	#	It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)
2	#	Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.
2	#	It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.
2	#	Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)
2	#	(annoyed) Good for the tuna.
2	#	So what? What am I supposed to do?
2	#	Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.
2	#	Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.
2	#	Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!
2	#	Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.
2	#	My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
2	#	Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
2	#	I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.
2	#	Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
2	#	That won't be necessary.
2	#	Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!
2	#	I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.
2	#	I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
2	#	Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -
2	#	Day was -
2	#	Yes!
2	#	Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.
2	#	Yes funny (laughs; hand clap) let's go.
2	#	Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.
2	#	Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.
2	#	Of course.
2	#	I am different, yeah.
2	#	Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!
2	#	The New York Yankees!
2	#	I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!
2	#	Ya!
2	#	And I'm moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?
2	#	I'm back in business, baby!
2	#	Hey! (to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful)
2	#	Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)
2	#	Instinct.
2	#	Yeah, it's the last one.
2	#	Alright, let's go.
2	#	I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
2	#	I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.
2	#	Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress ) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'. (Turns to the Gang) So, let's see, I had a little conversation today with Mr Don Mattingly - (to Elaine) he's the first base man.
2	#	We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.
2	#	O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.
2	#	No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!
2	#	What are all sweatin' for?
2	#	Hot? (Feels Tartabull's material.) What is this?
2	#	This uniform, what's it made from?
2	#	No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!
2	#	I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
2	#	You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
2	#	Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.
2	#	Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)
2	#	Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
2	#	You're incredible.
2	#	What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!
2	#	Chaperone? What, are you kidding?
2	#	What does the chaperone do?
2	#	Can she talk?
2	#	You're calling her?
2	#	Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?
2	#	Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.
2	#	I don't know. That's all gonna change.
2	#	Why shouldn't I?
2	#	How do you know?
2	#	Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?
2	#	How's everything going? Everything O.K.?
2	#	Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.
2	#	Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.
2	#	Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.
2	#	Oh - I've got something.
2	#	Well, did you see it?
2	#	The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "
2	#	Really!
2	#	Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	How was the show?
2	#	I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.
2	#	I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!
2	#	Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
2	#	Good night, Stan.
2	#	Oh. (Goes back into the bathroom.)
2	#	That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.)
2	#	Hey, hey! Yankee game! (Changes the channel.)
2	#	Hey, hey.
2	#	Elaine, Julie.
2	#	Hey, wanna get some lunch?
2	#	Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?
2	#	Sure, all right, what do you want?
2	#	What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
2	#	I've never seen a big salad.
2	#	Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
2	#	No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?
2	#	(???), we'll see you in a little while.
2	#	Oh, Safire. Uh ha
2	#	He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
2	#	Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating. You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert" it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All right. (check arrives) All right. I
2	#	No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.
2	#	Hey, hey.
2	#	No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.
2	#	Ya, you go.
2	#	Did you see what just happened?
2	#	Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
2	#	Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.
2	#	Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
2	#	I mean I'm the one who bought it.
2	#	You think she should have said something?
2	#	Oh, I know.
2	#	You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if they knew it.
2	#	Yeah, she's very lovely.
2	#	So did you enjoy your lunch?
2	#	oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, . . .
2	#	. . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's the difference?
2	#	It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.
2	#	No, no,
2	#	There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing the big salad.
2	#	You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?
2	#	A ha! We're just friends.
2	#	Oh, share.
2	#	Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.
2	#	Well, she probably just assumed.
2	#	. . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, that it came from me?
2	#	. . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?
2	#	You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. But you had to have the BIG SALAD.
2	#	The rule is a minimum of two days.
2	#	I'm making it up.
2	#	Oh, well, a mantel's a whole different story.
2	#	If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.
2	#	Let's have it.
2	#	You want me to ask one of the Yankees.
2	#	Alright. I'll run it by a few people.
2	#	Who was flirting with you?
2	#	She wasn't flirting with you.
2	#	Really?
2	#	He probably doesn't want to get chocolate on his fingers. That's the way these society types eat their candy bars.
2	#	What, you think I eat all my meals with you? (To waitress) Excuse me, sweetheart? I think you may have overcharged us. What is this?
2	#	Got it. (the waitress walks away) Did you just see what happened here?
2	#	Did you see the way she pointed at the check? She gave me the finger.
2	#	So, what do you think?
2	#	Channel eleven? Forgive me for trying to class up this place, for trying to have the Yankees reach another strata of society that might not watch channel eleven.
2	#	I am eating my dessert. How do you eat it, with your hands?
2	#	You wanted a Yankee, I got you a Yankee.
2	#	Hey, the Bull owes me one, I helped him with his swing.
2	#	Absolutely. Pending approval of the script.
2	#	Jerry, I'm Yankee management.
2	#	Hey, when you order from the waitress, get her to point to the menu. I want to see what finger she uses.
2	#	I didn't get the special, but I'd also like the fresh fruit too.
2	#	(after waitress walks away) I don't believe it, she did it again!
2	#	She had an itch. She could have used any one of those fingers. That finger was meant for me.
2	#	Oh no, in and out, I made sure of that. And you'll be happy to know I perused the script and it's met with my approval.
2	#	(swerving) Hey! Watch it! Did you see that guy? He just gave me the finger!
2	#	Oh yeah! Middle finger, straight up, at me! At us!
2	#	I'm following him.
2	#	No one gives us the finger! We're Yankees!
2	#	No, you can have it.
2	#	I'll take care of this, Danny.
2	#	Excuse me.
2	#	I believe you cut me off, and then made an obscene gesture.
2	#	Outside of Manhattan, about an hour ago.
2	#	That's right, of the New York Yankees.
2	#	(on tape, lifeless) Hey, it's George. I got nothin' to say... (beep)
2	#	Hey, hey, hey! You don't call me back?!
2	#	...Huh?
2	#	Hmm, what's he doin' in the city today?
2	#	You didn't ask him?
2	#	(suspicious) You didn't say hello?
2	#	Why was he wearing a cape?
2	#	Was my father wearing a cape?
2	#	Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)
2	#	Plenty of mosquitoes.
2	#	So, Dad...
2	#	(pause) Dad! I heard you were in the city the other day!
2	#	Jerry and Elaine saw you.
2	#	Well, they were in a rush.
2	#	They, uh... said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape?...
2	#	So Dad,--
2	#	Hey-- (spots Donna)
2	#	Oh, I wanted to talk to you--I'm sorry, I--didn't know you... (re Donna) had company. (Jerry indicates he should stay) Hiya, I'm George.
2	#	You spoke to my mother?
2	#	Did you say, "The rines are crossed?"
2	#	(smile) Yeah.
2	#	Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?
2	#	Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!
2	#	Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!
2	#	You know what this has to do with?
2	#	The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.
2	#	All right Superman's the exception.
2	#	All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!
2	#	(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.
2	#	All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?
2	#	Your lawyer wears a cape...?
2	#	Who wears a cape?
2	#	All right! Come on! Let's not fight.
2	#	(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?
2	#	What?!
2	#	So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!
2	#	(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!
2	#	Oh, it had to happen!!
2	#	I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played "Clue"! All day with this! [Kew Gardens (see links at end of script)]
2	#	I got a feeling I'm gonna be much smarter than you pretty soon.
2	#	Nah, I don't like that one.
2	#	"Breakfast At Tiffany's." 90 pages. (Waves a hand like it's nothing.)
2	#	They wanted to read a Truman Capote book.
2	#	He's a great writer.
2	#	Did you ever read anything by him?
2	#	Nah.
2	#	Okay. "Breakfast At Tiffany's." (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)
2	#	I'm sorry I missed it.
2	#	Oh...pretty good.
2	#	Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.
2	#	Yeah, she's quite a character.
2	#	No.
2	#	I couldn't. You know, if it's not about sports, I find it very hard to concentrate.
2	#	No, I'm not. I would like to be, but I'm not. What am I gonna do? The book club meets in a few days.
2	#	Why don't I rent the movie.' See, this is when I like you. Alright, now I'm relieved. (Kramer enters and comes over to the booth.)
2	#	I'd like to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's.
2	#	Out? Oh no, I've been to four other places, you're the only ones that have had it.
2	#	Maybe we could call them and ask them to return it.
2	#	Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.
2	#	Uh, excuse me, are you Joe Temple?
2	#	Uh, yes, uh...you don't know me, my name is George Costanza...did you happen to rent Breakfast At Tiffany's?
2	#	Well, anyway, the book club meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.
2	#	She was a delicate flower.
2	#	Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my vision...quite blurry... (Joe's daughter comes to the door.)
2	#	So, anything to uh, nosh?
2	#	Popcorn?
2	#	Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.
2	#	You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.
2	#	Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.
2	#	Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'
2	#	You know, I'm sorry, I...I hate to be one of those people, but we're right in the middle of this thing...I can't hear.
2	#	Any more grape juice? (Gets up and goes to the kitchen. Remy moves to the end of the couch where George was sitting.)
2	#	So, we watching the movie, or are we still talking? (Joe's wife shakes her head and goes into the other room. George gestures to Remy to move.) Okay, c'mon. Let's go.
2	#	C'mon, you took my seat.
2	#	I was sitting there, c'mon.
2	#	I had the arm! Joe...
2	#	Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here...
2	#	Alright, c'mon, scooch over. (Tries to squeeze into the corner seat of the couch and struggles with Remy. He spills his glass of grape juice all over the couch in the process.)
2	#	Joe...
2	#	Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.
2	#	I think she finds my stupidity charming.
2	#	Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll swing by after.
2	#	Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll love me.
2	#	Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.
2	#	Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Hey! (heads toward bathroom)
2	#	(inside bathroom) Nah.
2	#	(emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.
2	#	What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.
2	#	I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".
2	#	Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.
2	#	ALL the way, baby!
2	#	Always.
2	#	Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most important thing in the world is spending time with family.
2	#	(hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.
2	#	Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?
2	#	Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?
2	#	No, I know I don't have to, I want to.
2	#	I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.
2	#	(spits out mouthful of food) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
2	#	No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!
2	#	Yes.
2	#	It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.
2	#	Above the rim.
2	#	It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
2	#	One little bite.
2	#	But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
2	#	(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.
2	#	Yes, good for me!
2	#	Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!
2	#	Did you pass your stone yet?
2	#	(singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." (takes a drink, makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)
2	#	I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-
2	#	Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.
2	#	Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!
2	#	(on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)
2	#	You think I'm going down?
2	#	I know.
2	#	Well, here we are.
2	#	Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
2	#	Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, huh? Whew!
2	#	And ah, Ill have the bacon club without the turkey. (raises eyebrows)
2	#	Why, you think you can, beat me up?
2	#	Huh, nggh [snort] Stop. (flirting with her he playfully hits her arm with the menu, then flicks it into the air)
2	#	Wow, is she not terrific?
2	#	You think she thinks I have a beautiful face, or is she just saying that?
2	#	George, don't make me get tough with you. Whu, hu, hu, hu huuuu (raises arms) Who says that? She is really cool. What do you think? You think she likes me?
2	#	Why should she like me? Who am I? Huh, there's a million people to like.
2	#	Maybe she could like me? Is it that far fetched? Maybe she sees something? Is it possible?
2	#	No.
2	#	Not possible.
2	#	Hey Elaine.
2	#	What trip? You were gone?
2	#	Hunh, pph (raises hands slightly, in amazement) How was it?
2	#	he he (laughs)
2	#	Flying him in? How longs he staying for?
2	#	All this in 5 days. Hmm.
2	#	Who's he?
2	#	Hi (raises his left hand in a slight gesture to say hi)
2	#	Take the suit.
2	#	Heh heh heh hey, new suit (raises coffee cup as a salute / toast)
2	#	(takes a large bite - with his mouth still full, his speech is muffled) Oh, this is fabulous.
2	#	Boy, she is nice. I like her, I like her Jerry. She's got substance. She oozes substance.
2	#	You mean a walk back in? That's the toughest move in the business. You're sending me out into no-mans-land, and if I get shot down I have to crawl all the way back. Well I can't do it! I can't do it, I tell ya!
2	#	I did it! It's all done!
2	#	I did it. Hunh, we're going out as soon as she gets off of work and it'll still be daytime. You know I, Im much better in the daytime then I am at night. it's less pressure.
2	#	There ya go.
2	#	(quietly) ahh.
2	#	Oh. It's just horse manure (huh huh - laughs, he points back at the horse that walked by) Horse manure's not that bad. I don't even mind the word manure. You know, it's, it's nure, which is good. and a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. I mean when you consider the other choices, manure is actually pretty refreshing.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Huh. Really?
2	#	Well, how about that?
2	#	Yes, I sure did.
2	#	What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?
2	#	Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)
2	#	I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.
2	#	Or something. I said, Or Something!
2	#	(snaps fingers) There you go.
2	#	What do you mean?
2	#	I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.
2	#	I mentioned how I liked horse manure.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.
2	#	Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.
2	#	So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?
2	#	Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?
2	#	Well what do you eat?
2	#	Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.
2	#	Yeah, yeah, she's here.
2	#	No, but Im very uncomfortable.
2	#	There she is. (waiving his arms quickly above the table - to nix the conversation) No no no no no no.
2	#	Hello.
2	#	What's it gonna be?
2	#	Ill eh, Ill just have a bowl of chili.
2	#	What's it gonna be? ... You hear that?
2	#	Did you feel that tension? We use to have banter - (puts menu back with frustration) - there's no more banter.
2	#	Sure you can.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.
2	#	What's the difference? Let's go to Reggies.
2	#	It's the same menu.
2	#	They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?
2	#	So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.
2	#	Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.
2	#	I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.
2	#	If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!
2	#	If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.
2	#	Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?
2	#	I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.
2	#	No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.
2	#	What Consumer? I'm the consumer.
2	#	Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.
2	#	Alright, maybe I do. So what.
2	#	I like (imitates Kramer) "cookies."
2	#	Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.
2	#	You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.
2	#	What do you mean "might"? You don't think he really owned this car?
2	#	Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?
2	#	Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)
2	#	Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.
2	#	Where did you get those?
2	#	Yeah, I got one too.
2	#	What?
2	#	No, what is it?
2	#	You didn't get one?
2	#	So?
2	#	I feel alive, Jerry.
2	#	Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!
2	#	Ah! See? I told ya.
2	#	So?
2	#	That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!
2	#	Get out!
2	#	Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.)
2	#	Did they take anything?
2	#	Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.
2	#	It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.
2	#	How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.
2	#	Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)
2	#	Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.
2	#	I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.
2	#	No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?
2	#	You should have somebody take a look at that.
2	#	You going to the party?
2	#	Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.
2	#	You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.
2	#	Maybe I'll just meet you there.
2	#	Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?
2	#	Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?
2	#	What, you didn't ask him about the car?
2	#	Jon Voight bit you?
2	#	Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.
2	#	Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.
2	#	It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.)
2	#	These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.
2	#	Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?
2	#	Hey, Tim.
2	#	Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.
2	#	Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)
2	#	Uh, Tim, the pencil...
2	#	Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?
2	#	That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.
2	#	Jon Voight, the actor?
2	#	Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.
2	#	Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.
2	#	Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.
2	#	Whatever.
2	#	(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.
2	#	You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in)
2	#	I can't imagine.
2	#	Hey hey.
2	#	Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.
2	#	Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.
2	#	You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.
2	#	Well whad you buy it for?
2	#	Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e")? I thought it was Demi?
2	#	Really? I never heard of a semi (the "i" sounds like an "e") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)
2	#	(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.
2	#	And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.
2	#	Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)
2	#	Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.
2	#	I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.
2	#	It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.
2	#	(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?
2	#	Is it, uh, doable?
2	#	Ade you are incredible
2	#	What? Oh, My God!
2	#	Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Not that Im aware of, no.
2	#	I didnt think ahead.
2	#	I didnt say any other bawdy things.
2	#	All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.
2	#	Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.
2	#	3 days.
2	#	What?
2	#	(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?
2	#	Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.
2	#	She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room)
2	#	Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)
2	#	She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.
2	#	You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.
2	#	Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)
2	#	Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)
2	#	(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.
2	#	You're making more than I am.
2	#	What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.
2	#	But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.
2	#	Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
2	#	Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?
2	#	Maybe he's just "very well RED"?
2	#	Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?
2	#	Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important." . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.
2	#	I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.
2	#	Duncan Meyers?
2	#	I looked up. I couldn't believe it.
2	#	So you lied to her?
2	#	Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?
2	#	And they say appearance is not important.
2	#	What's up?
2	#	He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.
2	#	Not bad? It's gorgeous!
2	#	Natalie?
2	#	Thank you.
2	#	Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.
2	#	Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!
2	#	George, George Costanza!
2	#	Yes yes yes This is unbelievable.
2	#	Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?
2	#	So what have you been doing with yourself?
2	#	Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you ever notice?" this kind of stuff.
2	#	It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
2	#	Yeah, yeah.
2	#	Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.
2	#	I'm an architect.
2	#	Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?
2	#	Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
2	#	Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry.
2	#	Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.
2	#	You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good to see you guys again.
2	#	Ha, uh,
2	#	Oh, the big race.
2	#	Yes, yes,.
2	#	Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.
2	#	Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .
2	#	But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.
2	#	Head start, oh no absolutely not.
2	#	(on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist Now he wants to see me in his office.
2	#	You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
2	#	C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.
2	#	Sir?
2	#	Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.
2	#	Okay, all right, all right.
2	#	You wanted to see me, El Presidente?
2	#	Si, si.
2	#	Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy.
2	#	Oh, oh!
2	#	Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.
2	#	Check that out (showing newspaper)
2	#	That's right.
2	#	What's that.
2	#	And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'. I mean I've never seen an appetite like this. Desserts. Everything. I don't know how she does it.
2	#	Wa?
2	#	Kramer, she's a model.
2	#	I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right after we finish eating.
2	#	Just enjoying watching you.
2	#	Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen the old belt and digest away for hours. Let those enzymes do their work.
2	#	Where you going?
2	#	You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem very fresh to me. You're very vital. I couldn't take you any fresher.
2	#	Well, I heard a noise.
2	#	You know, .. blah ...
2	#	From the bathroom.
2	#	Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating she's runnin to the bathroom.
2	#	Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals. It's like throwing money down the toilet.
2	#	Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what would be good is if there was someone else in the bathroom that could tell me.
2	#	Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out the towels in the powder room.
2	#	Yeah
2	#	Wha?
2	#	You know a matron?
2	#	You
2	#	Kramer,
2	#	Well, what is it?
2	#	Wha?
2	#	Who?
2	#	Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.
2	#	Why not? Why not?
2	#	Come on, Kramer.
2	#	Cosmo?
2	#	Hey di ho
2	#	Hey oh.
2	#	It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday at the restaurant where Babs works.
2	#	Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened to pick up another juicy little nugget about our friend.
2	#	I uh got the first name.
2	#	That's right. You ready?
2	#	Cosmo
2	#	Cosmo
2	#	Wow.
2	#	Oh yeah HA-A-A, HA-A-A.
2	#	Hate the big coarse "ha." Hate those.
2	#	I see.
2	#	Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.
2	#	The Switch?
2	#	Can't be done.
2	#	Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization no one has successfully accomplished the Roommate Switch? In the Middle Ages you could get locked up for even suggesting it!
2	#	Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.
2	#	All right, dammit, I'm in.
2	#	All right. Let's get to work.
2	#	All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some sleep. I'll see you first thing in the morning.
2	#	We'll come up with something.
2	#	All right. See you tomorrow. (George sighs, exits.)
2	#	I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!
2	#	All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.
2	#	That's right.
2	#	Keep going.
2	#	Continue.
2	#	A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy is known to be busy at work. Once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor, which she [Laura] of course cannot resist, an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered.
2	#	You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do with you. She tells Laura, "If you want to waste your time with that pervert, that's your problem."
2	#	(George, finger in the peanut butter jar) This is what I do.
2	#	... so glad.
2	#	And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh
2	#	Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs?
2	#	Babs left?
2	#	Ah Ha.
2	#	I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.
2	#	How 'ya feelin'?
2	#	What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night. The whole thing blew up in my face.
2	#	Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it. Did you call her?
2	#	So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?
2	#	So what happened?
2	#	Into what?
2	#	That's unbelievable.
2	#	Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that you know me and have access to my dementia?
2	#	You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not goin to do it?
2	#	Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by accident.
2	#	If only something like that could happen to me.
2	#	I know.
2	#	Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She hung me out to dry.
2	#	It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I just think you could have said something. That's all.
2	#	Well where is she?
2	#	No thanks.
2	#	I'm telling you, skip the Drake's wedding, go to the game.
2	#	Well who schedules his wedding on Super Bowl Sunday?
2	#	Lemme see. I can't believe you got these for free. (Looking at the tickets) Row F?!
2	#	Howbout Kramer or Elaine, they don't want them?
2	#	Wish I could help you.
2	#	You paying my hotel and airfare to Miami?
2	#	So in order to use these, I gotta spend like fifteen-hundred bucks. This is a bill for fifteen-hundred dollars. Plus, she'd ask about the sleeping arrangements, that whole sleeping arrangement conversation is depressing.
2	#	Oh, no no no, I haven't even seen her apartment yet. Tomorrow night's the first night.
2	#	Hey, is that Tim Whatley?
2	#	Yeah, is he still mad at you for crashing his Thanksgiving party?
2	#	Oh good.
2	#	I'm getting a makeover.
2	#	Wow.
2	#	I love it! This is fantastic! Look at this couch, is this velvet?!
2	#	A fan? I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable. And look at this, hardwood floors!
2	#	(bewildered) Heh heh.
2	#	So Scott's your roommate, huh?
2	#	No, you didn't mention it.
2	#	I'm sure I will.
2	#	Yes. A male roommate.
2	#	It's a huge problem, Jerry. The hardest part about having sex with a woman is getting her to come back to your place! He's already got that.
2	#	No. Believe me, he's not.
2	#	She's confiding in him about our dates. You always like the person you talk to about the date more than the date! It's just a matter of time till they realize, 'Hey, we could have sex.'
2	#	Exactly! You know how they get animals to reproduce in captivity? They just put them in the same cage.
2	#	Oh, that's the worst part of it. He looks just like me.
2	#	I look like me and I'm working from the outside. Who do you think is in the better position?
2	#	Ho ho. This bizarre ?harrod? experiment must end!
2	#	I gotta find a way to work this out, I love that apartment. It's so cozy, I'm ensconced in velvet. You know, if it were socially acceptable--
2	#	I've said that before?
2	#	Hey.
2	#	The wedding is off. Now you can go to the Super Bowl.
2	#	You just gave them to him two days ago, he's gotta give you a grace period.
2	#	Well, didn't he regift the label maker?
2	#	Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?
2	#	I have a point, I have a point.
2	#	Yeah. What's that?
2	#	(eating a pickle) Well they're his tickets, he can do what he wants with them.
2	#	Alright, I gotta go. I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
2	#	I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him. It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.
2	#	What a movie. Good choice.
2	#	Oh, Scott, Scott. He's really great, isn't he?
2	#	Yes he is. Let me ask you something. When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?
2	#	Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?
2	#	What's the massage situation?
2	#	Is there any work being done? Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?
2	#	Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit? I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?
2	#	I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate! It's unnatural, it's an abomination!
2	#	Hey!
2	#	I'm good.
2	#	How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?
2	#	Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!
2	#	Well, he's merry.
2	#	I had a little tiff with Bonnie about the roommate.
2	#	And there's you ticket.
2	#	Well, what happened when you got upstairs?
2	#	They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.
2	#	Oh. Oh!
2	#	That's right. It's just me and her.
2	#	I guess she did. He's gone, now I'm the man.
2	#	No, it's not.
2	#	Oh my god.
2	#	I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.
2	#	(walking towards the door) I couldn't leave well enough alone?!
2	#	I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.
2	#	Thanks.
2	#	What, what happened? Where's, where's all the stuff?
2	#	The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?
2	#	Here's the TV. I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl. Do you at least have some towels we could sit on? It's, like, a four hour game.
2	#	(internally) How am I gonna get out of this? Think Costanza, think!
2	#	Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.
2	#	Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Mnage  Trois?
2	#	Gary? Well, well, well well. Where the hell've you been? I've been leaving you phone messages for months.
2	#	Busy. Don't give me busy. Who's not busy? I'm busy, we're all busy, everybody's busy. All right, tell me, what's kept you so busy?
2	#	Hey, uh...
2	#	Kramer, I, I, I, uh, I need to talk to Jerry privately.
2	#	Kramer...
2	#	Hey, you're hurting me!
2	#	I swear, I swear!
2	#	Right, I got news. You ready? (deep breath) Gary Fogel had cancer.
2	#	You knew? How did you know?
2	#	Why did he tell you and not me?
2	#	How are you closer to him than me?
2	#	So, is he okay?
2	#	Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?
2	#	So why didn't you tell me?
2	#	So?
2	#	Well, I still think you shoulda told me.
2	#	Well, I wanna talk to him about this.
2	#	Mmm-mm.
2	#	That's what I'm saying.
2	#	If not mine, whose?
2	#	No, an old friend of ours, Gary.
2	#	(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!
2	#	You don't think I can keep a secret?
2	#	You don't trust my poker face?
2	#	(shamefaced) No.
2	#	I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.
2	#	Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.
2	#	Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.
2	#	(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.
2	#	Well I still think it was wrong.
2	#	(well, obviously) Yes.
2	#	(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.
2	#	Wha, that's a Kinney lot?
2	#	Fifty bucks a month, that's incredible! Okay, thanks.
2	#	You still owe me a secret.
2	#	Yeah?
2	#	What do think I tell Jerry everything? It's not like he's my wife.
2	#	Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?
2	#	(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)
2	#	(shifty) Yeah.
2	#	No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table)
2	#	My regular face.
2	#	What are you saying?
2	#	I got nothing.
2	#	What you talking about?
2	#	Will you stop it?
2	#	I don't have a flush.
2	#	(broken, shouts) Gary Fogel never had cancer!
2	#	The doctors thought he had cancer, but the surgery revealed he never actually had it.
2	#	Nothing!
2	#	That's right.
2	#	Well...
2	#	Oh, I could do it.
2	#	(snorts) C'mon.
2	#	You did that?
2	#	Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)
2	#	(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.
2	#	Because you were being so nice.
2	#	(shouts) You be nice!
2	#	Yeah. Once belonged to Jon Voight.
2	#	Oh, well, uh. Gary told me you said hi.
2	#	You didn't?
2	#	Regards?
2	#	So, you didn't think this was a date?
2	#	I thought it was a date.
2	#	What about the regards?
2	#	No, tell me.
2	#	Me? Oh yeah.
2	#	Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.
2	#	(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.
2	#	Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?
2	#	No. Definitely not.
2	#	I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.
2	#	The one who always sits by herself?
2	#	How did he do that?
2	#	Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!
2	#	(opening door to leave) He picked her up?
2	#	Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)
2	#	I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.
2	#	Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.
2	#	The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.
2	#	(to Jerry) Well, what d'you think?
2	#	No, say. I want you to say.
2	#	(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.
2	#	(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.
2	#	(leaps to feet) Jerry!
2	#	Please. (sits again)
2	#	Well, I'm, I'm just looking.
2	#	What?
2	#	(admiring himself in mirror) I did.
2	#	How's your life? All right?
2	#	Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.
2	#	Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?
2	#	Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.
2	#	So she's gorgeous.
2	#	Well have you got a picture?
2	#	Well, I have to see her.
2	#	Really?
2	#	Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
2	#	Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.
2	#	Pouty? I like that.
2	#	I'm excited about the pouty.
2	#	Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.
2	#	Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?
2	#	So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
2	#	Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
2	#	Why didn't anything happen between you two?
2	#	Yes I did.
2	#	What do you think I said?
2	#	I told her the truth.
2	#	Yes, as I see it.
2	#	What hat?
2	#	No.
2	#	You only think that because you know me.
2	#	I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.
2	#	Look, I guarantee she won't know.
2	#	(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.
2	#	Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.
2	#	No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.
2	#	Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
2	#	That's an interesting question.
2	#	How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
2	#	What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
2	#	She's bald.
2	#	Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.
2	#	Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says "Give me the Larry Fine."
2	#	You fixed me up with a bald woman.
2	#	Yeah, that's right.
2	#	So?
2	#	No I'm not. I *was* bald.
2	#	Elaine.
2	#	No, no, no Elaine.
2	#	Nooooo.
2	#	I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.
2	#	And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.
2	#	Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.
2	#	Going to need a little more coffee here.
2	#	I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.
2	#	Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach me to sing like you."
2	#	Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.
2	#	Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
2	#	I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.
2	#	Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?
2	#	So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?
2	#	Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here.
2	#	Yes, I think I would.
2	#	What for?
2	#	So, what, no lunch?
2	#	Oh. How's she doing?
2	#	Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.
2	#	Ya-hah.
2	#	I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
2	#	Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
2	#	Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.
2	#	Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?
2	#	What?
2	#	Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?
2	#	Really?
2	#	You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.
2	#	(surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for anything.
2	#	You're uh, physical therapist, right?
2	#	You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?
2	#	(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.
2	#	(happy) Oh! Okay.
2	#	Oh, thank you.
2	#	What?
2	#	I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
2	#	Why not?
2	#	I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!
2	#	(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...
2	#	(regarding the menu) What're you getting?
2	#	Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.
2	#	You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)
2	#	(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.
2	#	What for?
2	#	(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.
2	#	(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.
2	#	(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.
2	#	Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!
2	#	What d'you mean?
2	#	When did you leave the message?
2	#	(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.
2	#	Will that be cash, or cheque?
2	#	(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!
2	#	Elaine?
2	#	(leaving) Hah. Good luck.
2	#	Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the counter) Skiing?! (angry) So let people suffer, while you're shushing all over a mountain?
2	#	I hear everything.
2	#	Yeah. Let's go.
2	#	I hope so. I can't take him living with me much longer. He makes this kasha, it stinks up the whole house.
2	#	What?
2	#	Why?
2	#	Alright, that's enough.
2	#	What'd you do today, dad?
2	#	I don't have a hi-fi.
2	#	(leaving to the bedroom) I gave it to Cosmo.
2	#	(coming back in) Alright, alright. Can we go out and eat?
2	#	My father opened his shirt...
2	#	(nods to Kramer) Tell him, Kramer.
2	#	(waves his hands) Big breasts!
2	#	I was throwing up all night. It was like my own personal Crying Game.
2	#	(worried) Yeah, that's right. What if it's a genetic thing, like father like son?
2	#	No, no no. That skips a generation. The baldness gene comes from your grandfather.
2	#	You mean like a bra?
2	#	(thinking she means the breasts) What!!
2	#	Oh, Huh, imagine that.
2	#	(agitated) Alright, I gotta try and talk my mother into taking him off my hands.
2	#	(broaching a subject) Hey mom. What kind of woman was grandma?
2	#	Well, you know. You get to a certain point, you wanna know about your roots.
2	#	Yuh. What about physically?
2	#	Yeah, you know, what'd she uh, look like?
2	#	(to himself) You can't tell much from those pictures.
2	#	Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?
2	#	Bosomy?
2	#	(trying to laugh it off) No, I was just wondering. The information could be relevant.
2	#	(to himself) That's what I'd like to know.
2	#	(upset) Well, you've scared her off. We may never see mom again.
2	#	Dad. We need to talk.
2	#	(crafty) Not necessarily. Why don't you take back the couch you gave me?
2	#	Yeah, sure. (big smile) Then my father will have no place to sleep. (snaps fingers) He's gotta move out.
2	#	No, the cushion's turned over.
2	#	(enthusiastic) Yeah. You get a couch. I get rid of my father. It couldn't be more perfect!
2	#	Jerry took the couch back.
2	#	Oh, I pleaded with him.
2	#	Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. (gleeful) Mom's coming to get you.
2	#	(light) No. No, no, no. The cushion was turned over.
2	#	Ah! There's mom, there's mom.
2	#	Oh, of course. (motioning Estelle to enter) Of course.
2	#	(upset) But you can't stay here. There's no place to sleep!
2	#	No. Thanks, dad.
2	#	" That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my height...What was his name again?"
2	#	"Jimmy, right."
2	#	"Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya."
2	#	"HEY! JIMMY!!! ha ha ha........Great game."

2	#	"Plyometric?"
2	#	(to Jimmy) Wh...Where d'you get'em?"
2	#	"You sell them?"
2	#	"Hey listen, let me give you my card. It's got my home number on it. I want to buy the first pair when the next shipment comes in."
2	#	"All right Jimmy Good talking to ya."
2	#	"What day is today?....Aw. ..Tuesday! Damn it. I shouldn't have worked out today. Mr Wilhem has called a big meeting and now I'm gonna be sweating through the whole thing."
2	#	"Aahhrgh...it wouldn't take...... long pause, audience laughter) ten minutes from now, I'll be sweating all over again ,I can feel it. I'm a human heat pump!"
2	#	"Cold showers? They're for psychotics."
2	#	"All right, I'll see you guys later."
2	#	(still puffing)" Whoa!!"
2	#	"Hey"
2	#	(head down low) I...I wouldn't know"
2	#	"It doesn't help"
2	#	"I'll see you."
2	#	(to Jerry) "You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I cut a deal with him. We're gonna import a case of them together."
2	#	"There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven sales method"
2	#	"He jumps!"
2	#	"Will you stop with the Jimmies"
2	#	"Ha..harrr."
2	#	(angrily)"WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR DROOL!"
2	#	"BECAUSE IF HE CAN'T JUMP. THERE GOES MY SNEAKER BUSINESS!!"
2	#	"Argh!!..Anyway...Jimmy couldn't be here today so he asked me to fill in for him, and I'm sure that you'll be impressed at what can be accomplished after only a few short days of training.....yeah!"
2	#	"Whhhoooo!!!!"(taps on his desk loudly)
2	#	"Arrrrrrgh!! .. It's George.. Oh! Sports wholesaler. yeah. yeah. .. thanks for calling back. No , no , no still got the shoes, still got the shoes. Lots of them. This is.. beautiful athletic gear."
2	#	".....Well. I'm sorry. Call you right back."
2	#	"No!...not...nothing."
2	#	"Well...there's no room for someone like that in this organization."
2	#	"Hemmm!.. Fine!"
2	#	"...It's the chicken"
2	#	"It's the Kom Pau ... George likes his chicken spicy."
2	#	"I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told him that I was the one responsable for stealing all the merchandise."
2	#	"'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating from the Kom Pau.."
2	#	"George likes spicy chicken."
2	#	"....I like spicy chicken"
2	#	"No I didn't"
2	#	"George is getting upset.."
2	#	(knocks) You hem... wanted to see me Mr. Steinbrenner?"
2	#	"George would never do anything like that."
2	#	"Right!"
2	#	"Why would George steal from the Yankees?"
2	#	" 'course not"
2	#	"Sir?"
2	#	(energetically) "Well seems it's about time for George's lunch."
2	#	Jerry it's funny, Paula and I actually met because of Elaine.
2	#	..And I went down there one time to see...
2	#	If Elaine wanted to get some coffee.
2	#	Are you through?
2	#	So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches and it turns out,they're Paula's.
2	#	Oh! Dropped a napkin...(Whispers) Jerry!
2	#	What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth, she just spit them out.
2	#	Well I've done that.
2	#	Haven't you kissed her?
2	#	Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at his reflection in a coffee pot.)
2	#	This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.
2	#	Hehummm , Yeah!
2	#	No problem.
2	#	Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. (to Paula) All right you have everything?
2	#	Yeah.( reaches for the purse and finds a piece of paper . he looks annoyed.
2	#	Don't you see what this is?
2	#	Yeah!, a doodle of me...look at the size of the nose , the ears, all my features are distorted.
2	#	I'm grotesque . I look like a troll.
2	#	Don't you see what this says? How can you possibly like somebody ,if you think they look like this?
2	#	(gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily)
2	#	You enjoying yourself? (More laughs from Elaine)
2	#	You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?
2	#	All right, I want you to do me a favor.
2	#	I want you to find out is she likes me.
2	#	But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes me.
2	#	yeah!
2	#	Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?
2	#	So what did she say?
2	#	She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?
2	#	Those were her exact words, I like George.
2	#	Ha Haaaaaaa... Jerry how do you like that.You see I get myself in a dizzy, I'm all worked up and for what?
2	#	ha Ha..
2	#	You see.....WHAT!!
2	#	She said looks aren't important to her?
2	#	She thinks I'm ugly. I knew it.
2	#	.....So what's your point?
2	#	Oh!, so what. I'd rather she hate me and thought I was good looking....At least I can get somebody else. (scratching his chest) What is this? Why am I itching?
2	#	Hello..
2	#	Well I spoke to Elaine...
2	#	No...Why should that make any difference to you?
2	#	Of course not. You don't care what I look like.
2	#	I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and walk around like this and you wouldn't care?
2	#	Hu humm? i suppose we could go to Lincoln Center and I'd be wearing sneakers and jeans and that would be fine too.
2	#	I could..
2	#	Velvet...
2	#	It's the real deal.
2	#	That's right...We just had sex......You know Jerry I've been searching for someone a long time. Well the search is over.
2	#	He he...So huh! What's with the suitcase.
2	#	Why?
2	#	So where are you staying?
2	#	( mouth full) Hi, this is fantastic ( puts the pit in the a plate)D'you ever had a Macanaw peach?
2	#	Too bad , it's all done.
2	#	Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.
2	#	You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.
2	#	An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.
2	#	No, you're not a divorcee. Youre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.
2	#	No, you're not out there.
2	#	You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!
2	#	Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---
2	#	Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)
2	#	Come on over and sit down.
2	#	No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...
2	#	She's not out there!
2	#	Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?
2	#	Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.
2	#	Well, giddy-up!
2	#	You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.
2	#	I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.
2	#	(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.
2	#	Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.
2	#	Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.
2	#	Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.
2	#	You're gonna tell me...or not.
2	#	I got a headboard.
2	#	No.
2	#	Five-foot four. Why?
2	#	I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
2	#	Is it a clockwise swirl?
2	#	So, did you get your new plates?
2	#	What do they say?
2	#	Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
2	#	Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
2	#	So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)
2	#	(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.
2	#	You don't like the move?
2	#	You're kidding.
2	#	Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
2	#	Supposed to close with the swirl?
2	#	Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.
2	#	What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.
2	#	What happened to Putty?
2	#	Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. "By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there." "Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on."
2	#	Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?
2	#	I think that's mine.
2	#	All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.
2	#	It just came to me.
2	#	You mean in the end?
2	#	A counter-clockwise swirl.
2	#	What?
2	#	Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
2	#	It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
2	#	You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!
2	#	They say this guy's the best.
2	#	(stands up) I am.
2	#	Ma, don't cry!
2	#	Ma, your eyes!
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Really?
2	#	I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
2	#	Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're losing.
2	#	Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.
2	#	Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.
2	#	They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with this guy as it is.
2	#	It better be.
2	#	(Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?
2	#	Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must get that all the time.
2	#	No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...
2	#	How ya doin'?
2	#	Nice day today.
2	#	I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?
2	#	Yo.
2	#	Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?
2	#	Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated your apartment when you had fleas?
2	#	Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy.
2	#	What company was it?
2	#	Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...
2	#	No, not really.
2	#	Gotta go.
2	#	May I help you?
2	#	Oh, yes of course, come in.
2	#	Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?
2	#	Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When you fumigated for fleas over there.
2	#	Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. Morgan in?
2	#	He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?
2	#	(To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's all on me. Just do me a tiny favor pretend we're old friends. Oh my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.
2	#	That's... what we used to call him in high school, the exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.
2	#	I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the time.
2	#	Check, please.
2	#	Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!
2	#	Take toilet paper for example. Do you realize that toilet paper has not changed in my lifetime? It's just paper on a cardboard roll, that's it. And in ten thousand years, it will still be exactly the same because really, what else can they do?
2	#	And everything else has changed. But toilet paper is exactly the same, and will be so until we're dead.
2	#	It's just paper on a roll, that's it. And that's all it will ever be.
2	#	You find this interesting, don't you?
2	#	Something's up, there's something in the air.
2	#	Well, I think this is it.
2	#	I saw Siena again.
2	#	We discussed toilet paper.
2	#	Yeah, I told her how toilet paper hasn't changed in my lifetime, and probably wouldn't change in the next fifty thousand years and she was fascinated, fascinated!
2	#	Ok, ok, fine! It's changed, it's not really the point. Anyway, I'm thinking of making a big move.
2	#	I might tell her that I love her. I came this close last night, then I just chickened out.
2	#	Fifty-fifty.
2	#	Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
2	#	Once, to a dog. He licked himself and left the room.
2	#	Eh eh eh, can't do it, can't do it, sorry, I got a date.
2	#	Oh no no no, if you must know, I would rather be with her than go to the game.
2	#	Hey, by the way, if anybody wants an inside tour of the zoo, Siena works there as a trainer.
2	#	Yeah, yeah.
2	#	You know, I could have actually gone to that.
2	#	Well, I didn't want to break our date.
2	#	Because I... I love you.
2	#	Yup.
2	#	Huge matzoh ball.
2	#	Well, it's all over. I slipped up.
2	#	You have any idea how fast these things deteriorate when there's an 'I love you' out of the bag? You can't have a relationship where one person says, "I love you", and the other says, "I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.".
2	#	I mean, now she thinks that I'm one of these guys that love her. Nobody wants to be with somebody that loves them.
2	#	You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you.
2	#	I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first.
2	#	That'd be me.
2	#	Wait a minute, you were at a funeral, right?
2	#	Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this (George gives an extremely understated nod) That's the biggest.
2	#	Hey, they can't go, "Hey! You look fabulous!"
2	#	Girlfriend, yeah, right.
2	#	Barry?
2	#	What?
2	#	Oh my god.
2	#	She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!
2	#	That's the question, Jimmy.
2	#	I'm gonna do it.
2	#	I'd like to say it once to someone that can actually hear it!
2	#	Siena, I love you.
2	#	Yeah. Just confirming.
2	#	Where were you?
2	#	Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have to console her no matter what.
2	#	When you're talking about a movie like "Beaches", moving from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.
2	#	Hey. I gotta go.
2	#	I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
2	#	Gennice palying today?
2	#	Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You know that's a real problem.
2	#	Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.
2	#	I watched "Beaches" on cable last night. (wings?)  Give me a break.
2	#	Aaaaaah
2	#	come on it's just a game.
2	#	So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my building last night.
2	#	You heard him.
2	#	Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?
2	#	Who are you to decide?
2	#	Hey, look, Kramer,
2	#	Well, you got no place to go. I'll tell you what your problem is You brought your queen out too fast. What do you think? She's one of these feminists looking to get out of the house? No, the queen is old fashioned. . Likes to stay home. Cook. Take care of her man. Make sure he feels good.
2	#	I don't think we should see each other any more.
2	#	I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.
2	#	All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions is? Happy, Pappy?
2	#	Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll say, "Happy, Pappy?"
2	#	I'm "Pappy".
2	#	Oh, come on. What, are you kidding? GEORGE I'm much more comfortable criticizing people behind there backs. Anyway, look who's talking. You just broke up with with Melanie last week because she "shuushed you" while you were watching TV.
2	#	What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here.
2	#	What?
2	#	What?
2	#	No, we're not. We're not men.
2	#	I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
2	#	. We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
2	#	Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.
2	#	Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal.
2	#	Yes. Yes. Care. You know who I think about a lot? Remember SUSAN ? The one that used to work for NBC?
2	#	No. It didn't take.
2	#	Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great.
2	#	You thought she was good looking, right?
2	#	I was just curious.
2	#	Yes. Changes.
2	#	Think I'M not?
2	#	Me, too.
2	#	La-la-la...
2	#	La-la-la-la-la-la-la! [flashbacks to Susan]
2	#	It's GEORGE.
2	#	Will you marry me?
2	#	Ma, guess what!
2	#	No, it's nothing bad. I'm getting married.
2	#	I'm getting married?
2	#	Yes!
2	#	What difference does it make what she looks like?
2	#	Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?
2	#	She wants to talk to you.
2	#	Hey, Kramer, where are you going?
2	#	Don't go. Kramer! Come back. I got great news. Well, I did it.
2	#	I got engaged. I'm getting married. I asked Susan to marry me. We're getting married this Christmas.
2	#	Yes!
2	#	I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man. And do you know why? It's because of that talk we had. You were my inspiration. Do you believe it? You. That lunch was the defining moment of my life.
2	#	You're blown?
2	#	You like that?
2	#	It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was persistent. I was just like those guys in the movies. And it worked! She said "Yes"! I can't believe my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You think she's good looking, right?
2	#	Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
2	#	Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?
2	#	You what?
2	#	. . . she scooped her niblets?
2	#	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What about the pact?
2	#	What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook hands on a pact. Did you not shake my hand on it uh?
2	#	Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh...
2	#	Well, maybe not married, but...
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	. . . . . . Yeah.
2	#	Yeah. It doesn't make any difference.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Champagne?
2	#	Okay! Alright!
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Um, I don't uh, really think I can go.
2	#	Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.
2	#	Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.
2	#	She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart.
2	#	Yeah. see you later.
2	#	I am ready.
2	#	Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
2	#	Okay.
2	#	Yes, it was very, very good.
2	#	Oh, I sure hope so.
2	#	Hello?
2	#	They are?
2	#	Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
2	#	Uh, nothing. I got to go.
2	#	You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal.
2	#	Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from.
2	#	I got to go.
2	#	I will never understand the bathrooms in this country. Why is it that the doors on the stalls do not come all the way down to the floor?
2	#	Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?
2	#	A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.
2	#	Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?
2	#	It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.
2	#	(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.
2	#	I want your honest opinion about something.
2	#	No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.
2	#	All right. Okay, tell me what you think about this idea Extend the doors on the toilet stalls at Yankee Stadium all the way to the floor.
2	#	It's good, right?
2	#	You do?
2	#	Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.
2	#	Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, "Can we change the subject?"
2	#	Right. I mean, we're on a subject. Why does it have to be changed?
2	#	That's exactly what I said, except I used the word "momentum".
2	#	Same thing. My god, I'm getting married in December, do you know that?
2	#	Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.
2	#	Nah, it's not a good turn. December. December. Don't you think we should have a little more time just to get to know each other a little.
2	#	What, you think I could postpone it?
2	#	That's allowed? You're allowed to postpone it?
2	#	So, I could do that?
2	#	All right! All right. I'll tell you what. How about this? Got the date; March 21st, the first day of spring.
2	#	Huh? You know? Spring. Rejuvenation. Rebirth. Everything's blooming. All that crap.
2	#	She's not gonna like it.
2	#	You know, I think I'm a little bit scared of her. She's five-three, like a hundred pounds. I'm frightened to death of her.
2	#	Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.
2	#	March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?
2	#	You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody I wouldn't turn you in.
2	#	Hi,
2	#	Good, good day. How was your day?
2	#	Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry.
2	#	The Lowers, really?
2	#	No, I want to go.
2	#	Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have an unbelievable idea today!
2	#	Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's something else. Are you ready for this?
2	#	Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the first day of Spring.
2	#	No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the
2	#	Still marry , still marry.
2	#	Sstill love. Still love.
2	#	No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference to me. It's fine. Really.
2	#	Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff.
2	#	How did you know that?
2	#	I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going to collapse and kill herself.
2	#	You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.
2	#	I didn't have any sex.
2	#	I didn't have make-up sex.
2	#	Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!
2	#	Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
2	#	This is amazing. (George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand) Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll feel better (to woman)
2	#	(enters) Hi.
2	#	Good, good day. How was your day?
2	#	Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute?
2	#	You see this is the thing. . . . (crying) I just feel . . . mumble, cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, (cry)
2	#	Yeah?
2	#	All right. (smiles behind her back)
2	#	Hey oh.
2	#	Alright, thanks a lot.
2	#	Oh, deserve! I don't know if I deserve...I mean...
2	#	Well, I guess I'm getting older.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Yeah. Thanks. Hey, listen, if you ever get a date, maybe the four of us could go out together sometime.
2	#	Wait, as a matter of fact, wasn't there some guy in your building that you said you liked? He lived up on the fifth floor or something.
2	#	Yeah! Boy, she is something, isn't she?
2	#	Nope. I wept like a baby.
2	#	Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.
2	#	I bawled uncontrollably. I just poured my guts out. And I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible. I never realized how powerful these tears are. I could have postponed it another five years if I wanted to.
2	#	Wait. Whoa! That's the Rabbi from Elaine's building. I just met this guy the other day.
2	#	And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.
2	#	Ya know, I was just a little surprised.
2	#	What about all the loser stuff?
2	#	(Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.
2	#	I'm going shopping with Susan.
2	#	Clothes shopping.
2	#	Ross'.
2	#	Yeah, it's her uncle's.
2	#	(As he leaves) One would hope.
2	#	I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.
2	#	All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya know there are a lot of woman that would love to be in your position right now.
2	#	See now this I don't get.
2	#	The security guard.
2	#	Why does he have to stand?
2	#	But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like that all day? That's brutal. I think I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
2	#	Aren't you concerned about the security guard?
2	#	(Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security guard. What kind of a person is this? I'm marrying a person who doesn't care that this man has to stand here 8 hours a day when he could easily be sitting.
2	#	Yeah. You like it.
2	#	Why, the color?
2	#	Too flashy?
2	#	(Obviously lying) No.
2	#	Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does it bother you that they make the security guard just stand there all day?
2	#	See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different. I can sense the slightest human suffering.
2	#	Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?
2	#	What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!
2	#	Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
2	#	Who?
2	#	(Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!
2	#	(To guard) Tired?
2	#	How come uh, no chair?
2	#	I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.
2	#	No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?
2	#	Would you like a chair?
2	#	Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?
2	#	That's exactly my point.
2	#	Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.
2	#	Who?
2	#	Bob Cobb?
2	#	Oh I missed the Maestro?
2	#	Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?
2	#	So what do you care?
2	#	Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?
2	#	It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
2	#	It's a big region.
2	#	I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
2	#	All right.
2	#	So I spoke to the security guard.
2	#	Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.
2	#	Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.
2	#	Oh I think I'd go for the back.
2	#	I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.
2	#	You mean one of those vinyl things?
2	#	Vinyl yeah, maybe.
2	#	Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.
2	#	What do you think about a rocking chair?
2	#	What's your name?
2	#	I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.
2	#	Innocent mistake.
2	#	Well, here you go. What do you think?
2	#	Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.
2	#	Your wake up guy asked you out?
2	#	Now you're off on a topic.
2	#	You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.
2	#	( rubbing his eye) Ow, Ow you squirted me.
2	#	Boy, it stings.
2	#	No.
2	#	No, not that I know of. (winks)
2	#	Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
2	#	No problem here.
2	#	I had no idea.
2	#	Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that Jerry squirted at me.
2	#	Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.
2	#	Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?
2	#	Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.
2	#	Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over the office.
2	#	Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks. (winks)
2	#	Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
2	#	Birthday card?
2	#	Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.
2	#	Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
2	#	Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?
2	#	Really?
2	#	Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.
2	#	Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake up service. She swears by this thing.
2	#	Ah, not yet.
2	#	Yes sir!
2	#	You got the Yankee envelope?
2	#	oh,
2	#	Hey, he,
2	#	What is this?
2	#	Who told you to sell the card?
2	#	No I didn't!
2	#	I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.
2	#	Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
2	#	(holds eyes wide open) Get it back!
2	#	He's not here?
2	#	It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
2	#	. . . gone?
2	#	I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.
2	#	Napkins?
2	#	What exactly is mutton?
2	#	No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the card not being here. I, uh, . . .
2	#	You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?
2	#	Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.
2	#	Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.
2	#	Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right for it.
2	#	I know.
2	#	I know.
2	#	That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .
2	#	This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
2	#	Not that much.
2	#	Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending that I'm busy.
2	#	I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all the time, people think that you're busy. Think about it... (acts annoyed for 3 seconds).
2	#	I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. (gets up) Back to work. (acts annoyed and leaves)
2	#	I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
2	#	uh-uh. What's with the bucket?
2	#	You put a hot tub... in your living room?
2	#	Is that tolerable?
2	#	He uh...doesn't have any running water?
2	#	Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. Mr. Wilhelm comes in)
2	#	Well...I've got a lot to do!
2	#	(smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make it.
2	#	Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...
2	#	Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost.
2	#	Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at Zeke, they all laugh) I can hold my own! (they all continue laughing and drinking)
2	#	Hey, you bastards.
2	#	I really like those sons of bitches.
2	#	Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either a bastard or a son of a bitch. Yeah, it's like uh..."boy, that son of a bitch Box can really hit, uh?!" (laughs)
2	#	Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)
2	#	What's goin'on?
2	#	Hello?
2	#	(laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?
2	#	What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? Don't they know that's against FAA regulation?
2	#	Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements the minute you land. Our boys can't wait to kick your butts!
2	#	You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston. Not as long as you bastards are running things.
2	#	(Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to Houston! Not as long as you bastards are running things!
2	#	Mr.Wilhelm...
2	#	Well I-I...
2	#	Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!
2	#	Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
2	#	It's huge!
2	#	(Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?
2	#	Jean-Paul?
2	#	You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?
2	#	Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...
2	#	(bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...
2	#	All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway.
2	#	All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Yes. Please. Please, let's go.
2	#	Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there.
2	#	All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again.
2	#	All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive.
2	#	This line is huge.
2	#	Isn't that that Bania guy?
2	#	Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
2	#	Medium turkey chili.
2	#	I didn't get any bread.
2	#	Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread.
2	#	$2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
2	#	Yes, please.
2	#	What?
2	#	You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any?
2	#	Why can't we share?
2	#	Do you hear yourself?
2	#	Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.
2	#	I'm going.
2	#	You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so.
2	#	I just don't feel like it anymore.
2	#	Just like that.
2	#	No. I didn't get it.
2	#	I made a mistake.
2	#	All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.
2	#	Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?
2	#	Why do they have to do that in front of people?
2	#	What is that with the shmoopy?
2	#	The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!
2	#	I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy.
2	#	And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
2	#	You know, we absolutely should.
2	#	I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes.
2	#	I still haven't figured him out.
2	#	All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
2	#	Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
2	#	Sorry. Thank you.
2	#	Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this.
2	#	Hup! Hup!
2	#	Hello.
2	#	Hello.
2	#	Were you just talking about me? What's going on?
2	#	Something's going on here.
2	#	So, how was the movie?
2	#	Oh, yeah?
2	#	Happy? Why should I be happy?
2	#	Why should I care?
2	#	All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine?
2	#	Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting!
2	#	People who do that should be arrested.
2	#	Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know.
2	#	You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
2	#	Mmm-hmm. You reneged.
2	#	Ah-ha!
2	#	Oh, yes. Hello.
2	#	No, thanks.
2	#	Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?
2	#	I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty.
2	#	Ahh. Good for you.
2	#	I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?
2	#	Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.
2	#	Come here.
2	#	How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
2	#	Huh?
2	#	Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey.
2	#	Really?
2	#	You did?
2	#	Yeah. See ya.
2	#	Yeah, I better grab some too.
2	#	You sure?
2	#	My code?
2	#	No. No way.
2	#	It says very clearly, 'for your protection, do not give your secret code to anyone.'
2	#	Why does everything have to be 'us'? Is there no 'me' left? Why can't there be some things just for me? Is that so selfish?
2	#	Have you ever given your code to anyone?
2	#	Superman's father on Krypton.
2	#	No. I am not giving my code to anyone for any reason.
2	#	If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.
2	#	What's the matter with your leg?
2	#	How'd your foot fall asleep?
2	#	Hey Fred.
2	#	Alright, bye.
2	#	Why? Why is my code so important?
2	#	Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.
2	#	Yeah, I never know what's going on there.
2	#	Please.
2	#	We're out of Bosco!
2	#	Where we gonna eat?
2	#	Peterman? Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman.
2	#	No way.
2	#	I don't even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna have to be on all night. I don't like being on, Jerry, I would much rather be off.
2	#	Call the Embassy.
2	#	Why?
2	#	We're in Turkey?
2	#	My card won't work there; they're not on the Plus system.
2	#	(grabbing lapels) J. Crew.
2	#	What's going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?
2	#	What, is he crazy?
2	#	I've got nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank.
2	#	I'm choking!
2	#	Howbout sports? Do you follow sports?
2	#	You know, this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really.
2	#	I'm, uh, George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son.
2	#	Yeah. What time is it?
2	#	Who?
2	#	Hi. I-I really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh, we had this big fight yesterday and, uh, well she, she wants to-to know my secret code. I-I don't know, I can't tell her. The funny thing is, you know, I would really love to tell someone 'cause it's killing me. You uh, you wanna know what it is? It's Bosco. You know, the chocolate syrup? I love that stuff, I pour it in milk, it's my favorite drink. Hoo-hoo, boy, that is a relief!
2	#	Oh, shhh.
2	#	Shut up! Shut up!
2	#	You know this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't bailed out on me at the restaurant.
2	#	Well why couldn't you include me in your excuse?
2	#	I froze. I think I'm losing it.
2	#	No, no. I reached down and there was *nothing* there.
2	#	Now Peterman wants me to go to the funeral.
2	#	I am not giving you my code.
2	#	Pssh. Yeah. Right.
2	#	Huh?
2	#	Get out of here.
2	#	I'm leaving.
2	#	I gotta go.
2	#	Shut up!
2	#	Shut up!
2	#	What was that?
2	#	You just checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?
2	#	Mothers say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy person.
2	#	Uh, yes, actually we-we both do.
2	#	Well, personal, I mean, we both uh...
2	#	Yes, and I'm speaking at a men's' conference.
2	#	I don't have my ATM card.
2	#	What?! Why?
2	#	But I-I-I-
2	#	Hm. Thanks.
2	#	Hm?
2	#	The Rogue's Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little secret. Short, devious, balding. his name was Costanza. He killed my mother.
2	#	Let me ask you a question. Who would win in a fight between you and me?
2	#	Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?
2	#	Yeah. Me too.
2	#	Ah-Ha! (he turns and walks over to the refrigerator)
2	#	Pull hair, Poke eyes, Groin stuff. Whatever I gotta do. (he opens a blue bottled beverage)
2	#	Would I want to see what Mary Todd wore to Lincoln's funeral?
2	#	I wonder if, ah, Susan ... (picks up the phone from the coffee table, then decides not to call) No. I better just go. (claps hands) heh. All right! See ya. (grabs his rain coat from the hook by the door and rushes out)
2	#	Hello?
2	#	Hey Elainie. What's going on?
2	#	Ha, Yeah right, hang on, Ill ah, Ill get her for you. he, he, he, he. Seriously, what's up?
2	#	Susan, why?
2	#	Oh, I don't think you want to do that.
2	#	Well what would be the point of that?
2	#	Where did this come from all of a sudden?
2	#	I really think I should have been consulted about this.
2	#	Here ... something.
2	#	By the way, have you spoken to Elaine yet today?
2	#	(sighs) She called Susan last night.
2	#	How do you know?
2	#	Your idea?
2	#	Whad you do that for?
2	#	Well that was a really stupid thing! You know what's going to happen now?
2	#	Whe ... Well yeah!
2	#	YES! It Blows Up! If you knew that, what did you tell Elaine for?
2	#	You couldn't figure out the World's Theory for yourself? It's just common sense. Anybody knows, ya gotta keep your worlds apart. (gesturing with hands going outward)
2	#	Hey.
2	#	He knows the worlds theory.
2	#	Ha! (grabs his coat and exits the apartment)
2	#	You know, uh, she has no female friends! You know that, don't cha? Something strange about a woman whos friends are all men.
2	#	You talked all about that?
2	#	Did you just say vault?
2	#	You got that from Elaine.
2	#	Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?
2	#	Wed all go to movie on Friday?
2	#	This is not good. World's are colliding! George is getting upset!
2	#	Ah you have no idea of the magnitude of this thing. If she is allowed to infiltrate this world, then George Costanza as you know him, Ceases to Exist! You see, right now, I have Relationship George, but there is also Independent George. That's the George you know, the George you grew up with -- Movie George, Coffee shop George, Liar George, Bawdy George.
2	#	Me Too! And he's Dying Jerry! If Relationship George walks through this door, he will Kill Independent George! A George, divided against itself, Cannot Stand!
2	#	You're Killing Independent George! You know that, don't you?
2	#	You know what word Susan used last night? Hnuh. Vault! hu,
2	#	She got that from you!
2	#	Is she the only girl in the whole world? Why can't you get find your own girl?
2	#	You see (to Jerry). You see. You see what Im talking about. It's all just slipping away. And you're letting it happen. (exits -- slamming the door)
2	#	One, two ... three, four.
2	#	Ha Ho! (he turns and walks out the door)
2	#	What the hell is this? George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. With Jerry, huh? With Jerry! Great. Great! (dials phone) Probably went to the 84th St. That's where I always go with Jerry.
2	#	Come on. Come on.
2	#	What?
2	#	Chunnel ?
2	#	Lowes Paragon, 84th and Broadway.
2	#	Yeah, now I gotcha! (hangs up the phone and rushes out the door)
2	#	Jerry ... Where are you? I know you like to sit back here. Elaine! Susan!
2	#	Susan! Jerry! Where are you? I know you're there! Answer me!
2	#	Hey. Hey. Answer me! Come on, show yourselves!
2	#	Drink your soda! Come on! I know you're there, laughing at me. Laughing and lying and laughing! I had to go to Reggies, Jerry! Reggies!
2	#	Where are you!
2	#	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Chunnel . Susan!
2	#	Two theaters?
2	#	Oh. Sorry.
2	#	I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.
2	#	They're -- They're killing independent George! And they're, they're all in on it! World's are colliding!
2	#	Not as thin as you think.
2	#	The tag, huh?
2	#	Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's just leave it at that.
2	#	He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
2	#	Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe I just told you that.
2	#	Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.
2	#	Where did you get that from?
2	#	I never heard of that.
2	#	I've coupled! I've coupled!
2	#	This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the loop!
2	#	Hey.
2	#	I had a fight with Susan.
2	#	Oh...(is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders) ...clothing, something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?
2	#	Lena, how'd you meet her?
2	#	You met her a few weeks ago, but...?
2	#	So, uh...wanna double?
2	#	Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.
2	#	Just for these sponges?
2	#	I dunno.
2	#	I, uh...figure it's something. (Kramer enters.)
2	#	Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.
2	#	I'd get tired of it.
2	#	Mick Jagger.
2	#	Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does a poet need an unlisted number for?
2	#	What are you looking at me like that for?
2	#	What are you talking about?
2	#	I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell you.
2	#	Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then I'm gonna go by the rule.
2	#	So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?
2	#	What for?
2	#	Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? (Pulls over.)
2	#	Me run in? Why don't you run in?
2	#	Of course I do.
2	#	You know. You use the, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
2	#	You know, the uh...(mutters it again.)
2	#	Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found out, they just took them off the market.
2	#	Yeah, so you gotta use something else.
2	#	O.k....(thinks) I think I know where we can get one.
2	#	Elaine? It's me, George. (Elaine opens the door.) Hey, sorry to bother you so late. (To Billy) Hey! How ya doin.' (To Elaine) Uh, did you get any of those sponges?
2	#	Well...Susan.
2	#	Susan loves the sponge.
2	#	What?
2	#	Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know about make-up sex?
2	#	Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is all that I have left.
2	#	Really? How'd she do that?
2	#	My Susan?
2	#	Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other everything!
2	#	What?
2	#	You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!
2	#	C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.
2	#	Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.
2	#	So, Lena was upset, huh?
2	#	What, it didn't bother her?
2	#	What?
2	#	Too good...
2	#	I see what you mean.
2	#	Where's the depravity?
2	#	You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!
2	#	Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of them.
2	#	Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.
2	#	Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're way past that.
2	#	No, no...I hate the condom.
2	#	I can never get the package open in time.
2	#	It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's a lot of pressure there.
2	#	I'm trying, dammit.
2	#	I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. You gotta do it like a bag of chips.
2	#	Would you wait a second? Just wait? (They fight over it.)
2	#	Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?
2	#	I'd kill to be a 32.
2	#	That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers on those things so hard to open?
2	#	You never run out, do you? (Jerry smiles.) Where's Kramer? Everything's finished here.
2	#	Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?
2	#	You think she's happy?
2	#	(indicates with his head) The cashier.
2	#	(surprised) You know her name?
2	#	I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
2	#	(gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?
2	#	Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch on TV?
2	#	Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?
2	#	Really?
2	#	(thoughtful) Breakdown, huh?
2	#	Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?
2	#	I don't chew gum.
2	#	You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change. Didn't I pay with a twenty? I'm sure I paid with a twenty.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	(almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete nervous breakdown. They had to lock him up.
2	#	The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my mother was 'Why can't you be more like that Lloyd Braun?'
2	#	Right, gotta get going.
2	#	Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.
2	#	Why d'you think I'm going now?
2	#	Hey, Mr Lazzari.
2	#	Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.
2	#	Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.
2	#	Something like that.
2	#	Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.
2	#	Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you look as pretty as you did back in high school.
2	#	Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?
2	#	I know. Completely bonkers!
2	#	Pop? What happened to Pop?
2	#	(a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?
2	#	(very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go.
2	#	I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough. Pop. Pop, put down the wrench, Pop.
2	#	Pop! POP!!
2	#	scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe I paid you with a twenty dollar bill, (smiles) but you only gave me change for a ten.
2	#	Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on the bill and uh, so if you have a twenty in there with big lips on it... well, (smiles) that's mine. Would you mind opening up the register?
2	#	Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.
2	#	I don't.
2	#	I know I gave it to you.
2	#	(frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for the door) Think I'm gonna forget about this? I haven't forgotten about this. I don't forget that easily!
2	#	Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable.
2	#	Warning signs?
2	#	(disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm not the one with the problem. (defensive) Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse, not me.
2	#	All my friends do that.
2	#	You see that woman on the horse? (points)
2	#	She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've gotten it back, but Lloyd Braun interfered!
2	#	(rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come back here!! Don't gallop away!!
2	#	I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.
2	#	(glances in mirror) Alright. Alright.
2	#	(getting annoyed) Hang on, it's warming up!
2	#	(angrily) Oh you mother...
2	#	Hey! What is your problem?
2	#	Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left on that meter, and I'm not budging til you admit you stole my twenty dollars. (smug) Huh-hu-hur, you're not so tough when you're not on your horse, are you Ruthie?
2	#	Aah! Fire!
2	#	(shouting) Fire!!
2	#	Your hose! Where's your hose?!
2	#	The Jon Voight car is no more.
2	#	No kidding?
2	#	Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.
2	#	(staring at the wreck) Whatever.
2	#	You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what he did there.
2	#	No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.
2	#	You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.
2	#	No, she wasn't on the horse.
2	#	That's right.
2	#	(points) And him!
2	#	Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a little crazy, but...
2	#	I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.
2	#	Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls to Jerry) Jerry.
2	#	Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!
2	#	Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...
2	#	Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.
2	#	I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd Braun!
2	#	Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is just a series of bad coincidences.
2	#	Believe me, I am not crazy.
2	#	Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.
2	#	(angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lemme get a pack of gum here.
2	#	(handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?
2	#	What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts) I guess I owe that cashier an apology.
2	#	No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.
2	#	Th... this isn't mine.
2	#	I got it from the Institute. The Institute.
2	#	(shouting) Dee... Deena!
2	#	Yeah. Yeah, one second.
2	#	All right. All right. Let's not get into panic mode! Let's not make a big deal outta this thing or we're never gonna get through this night.
2	#	My in-laws. Oh, my....
2	#	I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
2	#	This is gonna be fun.
2	#	This is delicious, Mrs. Ross.
2	#	It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. (laughing) Little chicken. It's a gamebird.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot.
2	#	Why don't we talk about it another time.
2	#	Did anybody see Firestorm?
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Oh mother of God.
2	#	Thank God that's over.
2	#	So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal.
2	#	What is this? The marble rye?
2	#	You stole the bread?
2	#	Because we brought it for them!
2	#	Maybe they forgot to put it out!
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why.
2	#	I don't know. They're all very suspicious.
2	#	Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them all separated for the rest of my life.
2	#	I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace that rye.
2	#	You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it would have to be the same one from Schnitzer's. You put it in the kitchen somewhere and you say Ohh! There it is.
2	#	What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it in there? I can't just walk in with it. I have to get the Rosses out of the apartment!
2	#	So?
2	#	And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them for a hansom cab ride. Y -- you think they'd like that?
2	#	So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back the bread is there.
2	#	She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to have dinner with everybody at eight o'clock so I'll set up the ride for seven o'clock.
2	#	You think Kramer'll do it?
2	#	Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half an hour.
2	#	Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the rye bread into the apartment?
2	#	Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge!
2	#	Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! (laughing)
2	#	What? He's outside?
2	#	Aw, come on. I wanna go see him.
2	#	Yeah. Hey! Hey!
2	#	Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?
2	#	Aw, well, you know, it's your anniversary. It's - it's the least I can do. I - I just want you guys to go out and have a good time. Ha ha. So, you think we should, uh, we should get downstairs?
2	#	Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's fine. Fine. Just get a little nervous on the weekends, that's all. Could I, uh, could I get a glass of water?
2	#	(thinking) Oh my God, it's 701. What have I done? My whole plan is depending on Kramer? Have I learned nothing? How could I make such a stupid mistake? He'll never show up!
2	#	There he is. Right on time as usual.
2	#	(whistling)
2	#	Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
2	#	What the hell happened?
2	#	Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!
2	#	(muttering)
2	#	Jerry! Up here!
2	#	I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw it up!
2	#	Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding me?
2	#	Come on!
2	#	(grunting) Hey! Hey, wait a second. I got an idea.
2	#	Come on! Come on!
2	#	Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. (grunting)
2	#	How? Cause Im an Idiot.
2	#	I was going to, but then I found out that the auto club has this free locksmith service, so I signed up. Just waiting for the membership to kick in.
2	#	I don't know, about three days.
2	#	Are the courses open?
2	#	Huh, No kidding?
2	#	How ya doin'?
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	(he drops a paper airplane he was holding) Mr. Wilhelm!
2	#	Assistant to the General Manager!! Do you know what means?!? He'd could be askin' my advice on trades! Trades, Jerry, I'm a heartbeat away!
2	#	And, it is all because of that car
2	#	See, Steinbrenner is like the first guy in, at the crack of dawn. He sees my car, he figures I'm the first guy in
2	#	Then, the last person to leave is Wilhelm. He sees my car, he figures I'm burning the midnight oil. Between the two of them, they think I'm working an 18 hour day! (he stands there with his hands on his hips, a wide grin - laughing.)
2	#	Hey, how ya doing?!?
2	#	Ah, that is disgusting--
2	#	Shes a pig. The woman's a pig, what wrong with her--
2	#	It's disgusting--
2	#	Come on! Come-on.
2	#	No, no, she might just think its a gift.
2	#	Ahh, Hey-Ho. ahhhhh (exhales)
2	#	Yeah, well I'm thinking about getting out of town with Susan for a few days....Her parents rebuilt the cabin!
2	#	Yeah well, they won't know. I got the car there.
2	#	My presence, in that office, can only hurt my chances.
2	#	This is the life! Isn't it, huh, kid?
2	#	Yeah, maybe. (snifs)Where'd you get that?
2	#	(on a pay phone) Hey, hey, it's George, I need ya to do me a favor.
2	#	I just remembered, th-th-there's this Chinese restaurant out near Yankee Stadium, that puts flyers on all the cars.
2	#	Alright, this is what ya gotta do I need ya to go out to the parking lot at Yankee Stadium, take the flyers off my car.
2	#	Alright, fine.I'll drive the 3 hours each way, 6 hours all together, and take 'em off myself!!
2	#	I think I got it. How 'bout this? How 'bout this? We trade Jim Leyritz and Bernie Williams, for Barry Bonds, huh? Whadda ya think? That way I have Griffey and Bonds, in the same outfield! Now you got a team! Ha ha ha.
2	#	Oh, would ya stop worrying?
2	#	Jerry took the flyers off the car, I got the whole thing covered.
2	#	What?
2	#	Dead?
2	#	My cars a little crumpled?!?
2	#	Allright, I gotta head back right away, I'll-Ill -- I gotta figure something out here.
2	#	I can't, Steinbrenner might still be there!
2	#	OOuuoo! They could use the break!
2	#	Mr. Steinbrenner--
2	#	Yeah, it's me sir. It's been a harrowing few days. uuh,After the car accident, I-I crawled into a ditch, and managed to survive on, grubs and puddle water, until a kindly old gentleman picked me up.
2	#	Anyway, as I was lying in the puddle, I-I think I may have found a way for us to get Bonds and Griffey, and we wouldn't have to give up that much.
2	#	I didn't get the job?
2	#	(through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are cousins. So your baby daughter is gonna be Susan's second cousin, right? So what does that make me?
2	#	(jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.
2	#	(negative) Hu-ho, boy.
2	#	Ech. What else you got?
2	#	Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.
2	#	Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, I'm gonna help you out. You want a beautiful name? Soda.
2	#	Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
2	#	All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you telling me people loved the name Blanche the first time they heard it?
2	#	Yeah, that's right. It's working.
2	#	I solve problems. That's just what I do.
2	#	I think they really went for that Soda.
2	#	Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.
2	#	Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A real original. You wanna hear what it is? Huh, you ready?
2	#	No, Seven.
2	#	Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
2	#	...especially a girl. Or a boy.
2	#	What, you don't like the name?
2	#	I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all around beautiful name, it is also a living tribute.
2	#	(angry) Well, that's the name!
2	#	(yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all crazy on me!
2	#	(adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name than Seven.
2	#	Alright, you having a good time there?
2	#	(shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, Jerry. I had this name for a long time.
2	#	Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
2	#	And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do it!
2	#	The same outfit?
2	#	How many days was it between encounters.
2	#	Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new wash cycle. You know, she did laundry the day after she met you, everything got clean and she started all over again.
2	#	Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
2	#	Very curious.
2	#	You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day.
2	#	(picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home.
2	#	(standing) Not yet, but she's weakening.
2	#	It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol.
2	#	Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
2	#	Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody else is gonna have it and I absolutely love it.
2	#	Why not?
2	#	So, what're you saying?
2	#	(disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, I made it up!
2	#	(anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!
2	#	(rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the yin-yang!
2	#	Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk.
2	#	It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
2	#	Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle!
2	#	(shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on Soda.
2	#	You don't care for Soda?!
2	#	(shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's refreshing!
2	#	What about Six?
2	#	Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
2	#	Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
2	#	(to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow Mantle that I would name my baby Seven.
2	#	(to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy...
2	#	(angry shout) So am I!
2	#	(to Carrie) You know, you're really being very selfish. It would be nice if you would think of someone other than yourself every now and then!
2	#	(desperate) Please! I have so little!
2	#	I'm family. I'm having sex with the cousin!
2	#	Seven!!
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Have you seen Jerry? (sitting beside Elaine) I told him two o'clock.
2	#	(distracted) Mm? (acknowledges Katy) Oh, hi. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We met uh, skiing that time. You're uh, married to the eye guy.
2	#	Nose. (chuckles) What's the worst that can happen to a nose? What does it get? Stuffed? (chuckles)
2	#	Ahh, ladies, please, please. (chuckles)
2	#	What? Is that bad?
2	#	Oh-ho, yeah?
2	#	(curious) Bald? Uh?
2	#	Loves bald? (laughs) Wow. Who uh, who is she?
2	#	(taken aback) The actress?
2	#	You're friends with Marisa Tomei?
2	#	(getting excited) That's, that's incredible. My Cousin Vinnie, I love her, she was fantastic!
2	#	(more excitement) You were gonna fix me up with her?
2	#	(fever pitch) Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine! Wh..why didn't you tell me that Katy was friends with Marisa Tomei?!
2	#	Really? Wow, you're quite the good son.
2	#	You gonna sleep on the fold-out?
2	#	Uh, let me ask you something. You uh, you ever hear of Marisa Tomei?
2	#	Yeah. She's uh, she's something, isn't she?
2	#	Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?
2	#	She happens to be very good friends with her.
2	#	Uh-hmm.
2	#	I don't know, I didn't ask.
2	#	Not the point!
2	#	Can I finish?
2	#	Alright! So, she said, that she could've fixed me up with her.
2	#	Well, you know, if I uh, wasn't engaged.
2	#	Coulda fixed me up with Marisa Tomei. She said I was just her type!
2	#	(getting animated) Yeah. Yeah. You know the odds of me being anyone's type?! I have never been anyone's type, but apparently, this Marisa Tomei loves funny, quirky, bald men.
2	#	(sarcasm) Hu-hu, like I don't know that? (excitement) My Cousin Vinnie, I love that! I, George Costanza, could be on a date with an Oscar winner! An Oscar winner, Jerry! You know what that's like? It's like if fifty years ago, someone fixed me up with Katherine Hepburn? Same thing!
2	#	I mean, you've seen her, right?
2	#	(shout) Marisa Tomei!
2	#	I mean, she's beautiful, right? She's just my type. The dark hair, the full lips.
2	#	Oh, I love full lips. Something you can really put the lipstick on.
2	#	(downcast) Yeah, too bad. Too bad.
2	#	Listen, lemme ask you a question. What if I got a cup of coffee with her?
2	#	(worked up) I can't have a cup of coffee with a person?! I'm not allowed to have coffee?!
2	#	(frustrated) Not necessarily.
2	#	(shouts) Of course there's something wrong! (points at Jerry) We had a pact!
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	I..I..I dunno.
2	#	(forcing a laugh) Hu, ha.
2	#	(whispering) Elaine, it's me, George.
2	#	(still quiet) Never mind, never mind. I need you to do me a favour. Uhm, remember what we were talking about at the coffee shop earlier?
2	#	(still quiet) Think, a second. You know, your friend was talking about me and, you know...
2	#	(still quiet) The actress.
2	#	(shouts) Marisa Tomei!
2	#	(calling to Susan) Uh, ah, nothing. Nothing.
2	#	Well, uhm, I think I'd like to do it.
2	#	A cup of coffee. That, that doesn't mean anything.
2	#	Elaine.
2	#	Elaine! (shouts) ELAINE!!
2	#	D'oh...Oh, oh, the judge! I hate this guy!
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Kramer, there's a guy out here that...
2	#	(pointedly to Elaine) Oh. Thanks very much for yesterday, by the way.
2	#	(animated) Fixed up? A cup of coffee! A cup of coffee is not a fix up!
2	#	(defensive) So what? So what if I do?
2	#	(worked up) I'm aware! I'm aware!! But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine. An Oscar winner! How can I live the rest of my life, knowing I coulda been with Marisa Tomei? She said I was just her type! She loves short, stocky, balding funny men!
2	#	Yeah, what the hell?!
2	#	(adamant) It's not cheating if there's no sex!
2	#	(frustrated) Ahh!
2	#	(pleading) Elaine, c'mon. Would you just make the call? (indicates the phone) Please, make the call.
2	#	(triumph) Alright.
2	#	(impatient) What about Marisa Tomei?!
2	#	Anyway, I was thinking about what you said. About uh, me and Marisa.
2	#	You know, about the uh, two of us getting together. And I know that I said I was engaged, but (laughs) uh, you know, it's really just something you say. It's like, going steady. You know uh, going steady, engaged, it's, it's all just stuff you say. (chuckles) Anyway, I was watching uh, My Cousin Vinnie, on the uh, on the tape the other day, and I was thinking that uh, you know, the two of us might take a meeting, as they say. (chuckles) So, what d'you, what d'you think?
2	#	(urgent) Move a pinkie, if it's yes. Can you move a pinkie?
2	#	(laughing it off and trying too hard) Yeah, yeah. I have a thing for Marisa Tomei. Like she would ever go out with a short, stocky, bald man. (forced laughter) Hu hu, ha ha. Like that's her type. Huh. She's an Oscar winner. (nervous laughter) He heh. Besides, I don't even know her. It's not like anyone's trying to fix us up. Who, who would try and fix me up with Marisa Tomei?
2	#	Not in the last fifteen minutes.
2	#	And I love you, Marisa.
2	#	(urgent whisper) Elaine! You have got to get me Marisa Tomei's phone number!
2	#	Yeahhh.
2	#	Marisa Tomei! I, just spoke to Marisa Tomei! (sitting opposite Elaine) And I wasn't even that nervous.
2	#	You know, I can't remember the last time I called a woman without being nervous. I, usually, I'm pacing all over the room, I'm...
2	#	Hey, where you going?
2	#	What? You can't leave yet.
2	#	We have to discuss my alibi.
2	#	I usually spend Saturday afternoons with Susan. She's gonna want to know what I'm doing. I can't use Jerry, he's in Florida.
2	#	Yes.
2	#	Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?
2	#	Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?
2	#	Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?
2	#	(dismissive) It's no good.
2	#	What?
2	#	Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.
2	#	(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.
2	#	Alright?
2	#	Okay.
2	#	Good.
2	#	Okay. How about this?
2	#	(pleased with himself) You are having problems with your boyfriend and I am meeting you to discuss the situation.
2	#	(still pleased) She doesn't know that. We say that you do.
2	#	It's good. Believe me.
2	#	The dentist thing?
2	#	Alright, the dentist thing was not good.
2	#	(after a moment's thought) Art Vandelay.
2	#	That's your boyfriend.
2	#	He's an importer.
2	#	(getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay?
2	#	(thoughtful) Yes. Yes.
2	#	It's very complicated.
2	#	Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.
2	#	I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.
2	#	Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.
2	#	He's an importer-exporter.
2	#	(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.
2	#	(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.
2	#	...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?
2	#	What, you think I'm doing material here?
2	#	(modest) And I'm a little tired.
2	#	Well, Marisa. See, the thing is... I'm sort of engaged.
2	#	I'm, you know, engaged.
2	#	Hi.
2	#	Matches? Long matches.
2	#	You know how hot it gets there? Like 150 degrees. Your skin is gonna be simmering with boils.
2	#	Hey, yeah. My parents want to come too, is that ok?
2	#	Uncle Leo's having regular sex?
2	#	Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?
2	#	I mean, they're retired.
2	#	They have no friends.
2	#	Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell are they still doing here? Lemme see this pamphlet. Hm. All right, so I'll, uh, get back to you.
2	#	Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, huh. Bitter cold, bitter.
2	#	You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? Seventy-nine. That's almost eighty. Yeah, I read someplace the life expectancy in Florida is eighty-one and in Queens, seventy-three.
2	#	What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet on coffee table)
2	#	That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great deal. Yep. You know what they got in Florida? Jai-Alai! You bet on the games, you clean up.
2	#	What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins down there.
2	#	You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto the sidewalks.
2	#	Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away.
2	#	Hey, hey, how was Florida?
2	#	Big news?
2	#	(ecstatic) What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! I'm so happy! (pause) For you! I'm so happy for you! Oh, what do you need this cold weather for?
2	#	What do you mean?
2	#	So you're moving there for spite!
2	#	That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!
2	#	Oh, every chance I get.
2	#	Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!
2	#	My parents are moving to Florida!
2	#	Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! I'm free!!
2	#	Del Boca Vista!
2	#	I know!
2	#	Every five years!
2	#	I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?
2	#	To spite your parents!
2	#	Yeah!
2	#	I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!
2	#	Beautiful!
2	#	I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
2	#	What?
2	#	What? Why?
2	#	Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. It's my turn to live, baby.
2	#	(Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.
2	#	A billiard parlor?
2	#	Well, that's.. Elaine!
2	#	(Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.
2	#	(Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.
2	#	(Confused) What photo?
2	#	(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.
2	#	I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-
2	#	Really? Why?
2	#	Who?
2	#	Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.
2	#	Hey, buddies.
2	#	Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.
2	#	Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's a big executive for Federal Express.
2	#	No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.
2	#	I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.
2	#	What's all this?
2	#	(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..
2	#	Oh my God! What is that?!
2	#	(Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.
2	#	I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!
2	#	What is this thing doing here?
2	#	Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..
2	#	I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.
2	#	(Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.
2	#	(Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.
2	#	(Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.
2	#	I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.
2	#	Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited.
2	#	Susan's college roommate.
2	#	So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll be delighted to talk to you.
2	#	You see?.. You see?!
2	#	Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly what she's gonna look like in ten years!
2	#	I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.
2	#	Hi, Elaine.
2	#	(Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
2	#	(Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he sheepishly walks out)
2	#	I just wanted a second opinion.
2	#	(To Susan) I told you it looked like her..
2	#	(joyful) June. It's June.
2	#	(high-fiving) Hey!
2	#	It's June.Mark's Michelle is a dog.
2	#	June, June, June.
2	#	(to passerby) Hey, he-hah. It's June, June.
2	#	It's Juu-uu-une! Hey hay. Yes.
2	#	I love Juu-uuu-uu-uune!
2	#	June. Juune, baby!
2	#	The catering hall screwed up. The wedding is delayed until June. It's like a stay of execution.
2	#	(pointing to Jerry in joyous agreement) Ha-ha-hah. This is my lucky day.
2	#	Yeah. Hey, wait a second, you know, good news for you too. Susan's best friend, Hallie? Broke up with her boyfriend.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	In motion. The wheels are in motion.
2	#	Aah, hey. (enthusiastic) If this works out, forget about it. Vacations together, movies together, dinner together. It..it's almost as good as if I didn't get married.
2	#	The Friars Club?
2	#	(smiling) Ho ho. Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy. Ha ha ha.
2	#	Friars.
2	#	Hup, here we go. Here we go.
2	#	(adamant) Ah, c'mon! I'm telling you, I can coach for the NFL. It's not that hard
2	#	(to Jerry) Oh, get outta here.
2	#	(to Jerry) You watch the old videos. (insistent) I'm telling you, look at him.
2	#	Look...
2	#	(entering) Last night, huh? Was that something, or was that something?
2	#	Ah. She's great, isn't she?
2	#	I told you.
2	#	You think she could be an 'it'? Could she be an 'it'?
2	#	(claps hands triumphantly) We might have an 'it'!
2	#	She's got everything, right? (counts on his fingers) She's intelligent, she's smart, she's got a great sense of humour.
2	#	Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.
2	#	(gleeful) Hehee. W..we could be like the Gatsbys. Didn't they always like, you know, a bunch of people around, and they were all best friends?
2	#	No. So, tonight she's got tickets for that show she's been working on. The Flying Sandos Brother.
2	#	Great. Seven-thirty, alright?
2	#	Sure. So, uh, Jerry, there's an empty apartment in my building. If you and Hallie want, we could try and hold it, may...
2	#	What?
2	#	Won't be a problem...(mumbles)
2	#	A-ha, huh. (mumbles) tours.
2	#	Isn't that the uh, Friars Club jacket?
2	#	Sure, sure, sure, sure. (patting Jerry on the shoulders) How about these seats? Are these fantastic, huh? Huh? I feel like Lincoln.
2	#	Give him the jacket.
2	#	This is very exciting. The inner sanctum.
2	#	(cheerful) Alright, there you go. She's gonna get the jacket back. (claps hands) So, let's go get some coffee, huh?
2	#	Really?
2	#	I, uh, oh, broke a shoelace today.
2	#	Okay.
2	#	Brown.
2	#	Maybe a black.
2	#	(urgent) No! Check! (quieter) Please.
2	#	It's a little unusual. So, uh, Susan and I were thinking, uh, dinner at our house Saturday night. Just the four of us.
2	#	(worried) Why not?
2	#	(standing) C'mon, what're you talking about?
2	#	You're soured?
2	#	Don't be soured.
2	#	(animated) What're you kidding me? We were all getting along so well. Where is all this coming from?
2	#	(animated) What're you talking about?! She's very concerned! She said she was gonna get it back.
2	#	(worked up) Because if she gets it back, then you'll have no reason to be sour. You'll de-sour, right?
2	#	(aggravated) Oh, that's not good enough! You don't try and de-sour. You have to sweeten too!
2	#	I wanna get it back when we were the Gatsbys.
2	#	(neither does he) Yeah, well.
2	#	(pleased) Yeah, it is.
2	#	The comedian, or the manager?
2	#	(meekly) Well, it's true. I saw it.
2	#	No, I uh...
2	#	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
2	#	Look at that guy. Right there. Isn't that the guy from the show? He's..he's wearing the jacket.
2	#	(motioning Jerry to follow) C'mon.
2	#	Excuse me, the guy is wearing a jacket that my friend is...
2	#	If I could talk to the guy for just a sec...
2	#	I told you, he probably went out the back.
2	#	Give 'im the jacket already!
2	#	What's he yelling about? They're stealing jackets here!
2	#	Moose?
2	#	Ohh, yeahh.
2	#	(smiling) That is really nice.
2	#	This is nice.
2	#	(forced buoyancy) Hey, you know, let's call Susan, we'll go have coffee.
2	#	(moody) Great! Now she's sour!
2	#	(angry) She won't sweeten, and I'm bitter!
2	#	Here. (panicky) We'll leave it here for you!
2	#	(still on the phone) All right fine.... Whatever
2	#	This friend of Susan's is staying with us for two weeks...Now am I wrong or is that excessive?
2	#	He's a wig master
2	#	He's with the touring company of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. He's the guy in charge of the wigs.
2	#	(leaving) Yeah, Sure, sure ,,, I got to drop my car off at the new lot.
2	#	Jiffy Park. It's incredible.. Seventy-five dollars a month.
2	#	Yeah and you get this really cool T-shirt when you sign on..
2	#	Good....good day (not too convincing) You?
2	#	Very nice
2	#	(grabs the phone quick) Got it, Got it,...Hello?
2	#	Yeah,yeah!! I'll pick you up right now.....All right All right....Hey! gotta go.
2	#	So the Wig master.......the Wig master said you could stop by the theater tonight.. and he'll show you around.
2	#	WOULD YOU PICK A STATION!!!!!
2	#	Aw great. Now the volume knob fell off
2	#	What?
2	#	I want to know how did that get into my car?
2	#	That doesn't explain the lipstick on the dashboard?
2	#	We're gonna hang around here a little while....something funny going on here
2	#	S'cuse me ..Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
2	#	Oh No nonono I'm not a cop ...Heum... I work for the Yankees.
2	#	Nevertheless.. I was wondering if you and your .friends are doing business here at the Jiffy Park.... You know ..hum What do you people call it? Turning tricks? Anyway I...I....found a condom in my car....and I'm not saying it's yours but.... I want to know if I should just change parking lots.
2	#	I'll pay you for your time....I just ..I just need some information . How much do you want? ten....fifteen? You have change for twenty?
2	#	Hi honey..
2	#	Of Course I'm telling the truth.
2	#	Really!
2	#	Well then...then you really have something to think about because.....you know if there's any doubt in your mind ....and.. and,, it doesn't even have to be a big doubt, you know even a tiny doubt, a DOT of a doubt.. and.....
2	#	Because if there's any doubt at all I...I feel we should cultivate it.
2	#	Yes, you know. Deal with it .We have to deal with the doubt, Susan The DOUBT!! Must be dealt with.
2	#	(hesitates) ...Nooooooooooo...
2	#	Excuse me...huh... I think I made a big mistake. I'd like my deposit back please.
2	#	You got hookers turning tricks in my car. How's that for starters.
2	#	Allright, very good I'd like my car and my deposit back please
2	#	Whadday'mean.?
2	#	Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..
2	#	. All right , just give me my car and let me get the hell out of here.
2	#	Why?
2	#	What are you talking about.. I WANT MY CAR!!
2	#	Bear with you! This is a parking lot PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO GET
2	#	I believe the doors on the bathroom stalls, here at the stadium, don't offer much by way of privacy. But I was thinking if we extend the doors all the way to the floors......
2	#	It's a calzone, sir.
2	#	Uh. Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.
2	#	You know a lost and found could be a good idea.
2	#	Definitely.
2	#	There putting in a lost and found because of me. There's a time limit but still.
2	#	Yeah. I am like a drug dealer. I got the guy hooked. I am having lunch at his desk everyday this week. He doesn't make a move without me. It's very exciting.
2	#	So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.
2	#	Not bills.
2	#	Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.
2	#	Without thousands of fleeing Japanese.
2	#	You know my last name is Costanza. That's Italian. So you and I are like country men. Pisano's!
2	#	And I always take care of my Pisano's. So here is a little something. (drop in tip and worker looks the other way, so George decides to take it out and try again only to get caught)
2	#	No no. That's not what I was trying to do.
2	#	I got your calzones Mr. Steinbrenner.
2	#	I thought tomorrow maybe we'd try a little corn beef.
2	#	How about Chinese?
2	#	I just thought it would be nice. A little variety.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.
2	#	What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.
2	#	Because before you know it he'll be having lunch with him. You know how these interoffice politics work.
2	#	What the hell is this?
2	#	There has got to be some way to get back into Pisano's.
2	#	Yeah. You've heard of it?
2	#	I'll see you guys later.
2	#	Yeah. And since you go buy there everyday. I was hoping that we could help each other out.
2	#	Are you going to help me or not?
2	#	What?
2	#	All right.
2	#	That's a little steep don't you think?
2	#	All right, all right.
2	#	But I have to have them by one o'clock. He's very regiment about his meals.
2	#	Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week.... Um shouldn't you be at work by now?
2	#	Soooooo
2	#	You don't work in the rain? Your a mailman."Neither rain nor sleet nor snow....."It's the first one.
2	#	You were supposed to deliver my calzones. We had a deal!
2	#	But I'm paying you!
2	#	Newman!!
2	#	Kramer!
2	#	Look I need you to do me a favor. I need you to get me lunch at Pisano's.
2	#	He called in sick.
2	#	Can you do it?
2	#	100 p.m. Do you need any money?
2	#	What happened? Where have you been?
2	#	What the hell happened to your shirt?
2	#	Your clothes smell just like Pisano's. There's another Italian place on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.
2	#	Because they were heated up there.
2	#	Sorry, the players will be reimbursed?
2	#	Sorry, Mr Wilhelm.
2	#	I know, sir. It won't happen again.
2	#	Yes, sir.
2	#	I will, sir. Top priority.
2	#	Top priority.
2	#	So he walks out of the stall, he's been talking the whole time.
2	#	LBJ?
2	#	No kidding?
2	#	Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.
2	#	I can't. He's been on my case about not paying attention. Besides, it's too late, I already told him I heard him.
2	#	Yeah, follow-up question, that'll work.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Where'd you go?
2	#	Why didn't you take your car?
2	#	Awright, listen, can you uh, gimme a lift back to my place?
2	#	Awright, I'll see you later.
2	#	Uh, Mr Wilhelm.
2	#	Hi, I was just uh... I just had one little question about uh, my assignment.
2	#	Yes, yes. Very smooth, super smooth. No, but I really wanna attack this thing, you know. Sink my teeth into it. So I was just wondering... what do you think would be the very best way to get started?
2	#	Well, I was wondering...
2	#	Payroll? No, no, I haven't done that.
2	#	Payroll!!
2	#	Hello there. I'm George Costanza.
2	#	Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction) I'm uh, working on the project.
2	#	Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.
2	#	You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little while. (moving to come round the counter) I'll just browse around.
2	#	Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have a problem with that, maybe you should just take it up with him.
2	#	(spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take it up with him. Go ahead, give him a call, he'll tell you what I'm doing here. (half to himself) Then you can tell me.
2	#	So he explained it all to you?
2	#	What'd he tell you?
2	#	(standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll... Paid off.
2	#	Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.
2	#	(to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, do you really think... Well, is this downtown trip really necessary, you know, for the project?
2	#	The song?
2	#	(thoughtful) Downtown.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some sort of a meaning.
2	#	When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can always go...'
2	#	Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never close...'
2	#	Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?
2	#	Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon lights are pretty.' Where the neon lights are pretty. The Broadway area?
2	#	The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares, just go...'
2	#	Things'll be great, when you're...'
2	#	I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.
2	#	You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I Should confess?
2	#	(hesitant) Uh, Mr Wilhelm. Uh, about the project...
2	#	I did?
2	#	Maybe somebody did it and didn't take credit for it. Maybe it was already done and didn't need doing in the first place. I have no idea who did it, what they did, or how they did it so well. And you know what? Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.
2	#	The point is, however it got done, it's done. So, any luck with the car?
2	#	Why not?
2	#	Hey.
2	#	I gotta go.
2	#	You wanted to see me, sir?
2	#	(smiling) Yes sir.
2	#	(wondering where this is leading) No sir.
2	#	(worried now) No sir.
2	#	What're.. What're you talking about?
2	#	Ah, see, Mister.. I didn't write that report. That, that's not mine.
2	#	I didn't do it! It..It just got done. I don't know how it got done, but it did.
2	#	(desperate) Steinbrenner had me committed! I'm in the nuthouse!
2	#	(quieter desperation) They took my belt, Jerry. I got nothing to hold my pants up. (listens) Well, you gotta come over here now! Just tell 'em what we talked about, how I, how I, I didn't do the project.
2	#	Aw, hoh, oh Deena, thank God. (he hugs Deena) Thank God you're here. Listen, you gotta help me. You gotta tell these people that I'm okay. You know that I don't belong in here.
2	#	Yea... (sinks in) What? No, no!
2	#	Deena! Deena, wait a... Deena, help!
2	#	This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.
2	#	You have a car?
2	#	Me either.
2	#	Oh, hi.. (They shake hands)
2	#	Yeah. Why, what do you do?
2	#	Really?
2	#	(Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than him.
2	#	Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything to do with what I said, do you?
2	#	You know, that, that thing about her being too good for him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just being folksy..?
2	#	Totally folksy.
2	#	(confused) What, what's going on?
2	#	What do you mean?
2	#	So it was my comment that broke them up?
2	#	I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no (starting moving for the door, Elaine begins to stop him)
2	#	Well I gotta go talk to Beth.
2	#	Well I gotta undo what I did.
2	#	Oh yes I am
2	#	(starts to try to get passed Jerry and Elaine) Alright get out of my way. (Jerry and Elaine push him back, George very annoyed) Alright don't make me get physical here!
2	#	Hi Beth (Scene Ends then re-begins with Beth and George on Beth's couch) Um anyway Jerry told me that uh.. it might have been my comment in the Coffee Shop that broke you up.
2	#	Oh (snorts) Articulate....Me? I've never articulated anything, i'm completely incoherent.
2	#	He..he wants to talk to me?
2	#	Sweet guy (Receives the phone from Beth, Starts to talk to Jerry) Hello
2	#	Oh Jerry, that is so sweet of you but actually i already ate.
2	#	(cuts into Jerry talking) Chocolate chip mint? Oh well, actually Jerry I prefer chocolate chip. What is it about the chocolate and the mint that makes it go so well together?
2	#	Oh of course you can use it, sure. (Jerry saying stuff through the phone) Ok, bye. (hangs the phone up)
2	#	(breaks a long silence) The uh, the shoe laces that you bought me, they uh, they worked out well. (thumbs up)
2	#	Should be a while though.
2	#	Oh uh hi Hi, David
2	#	Elaine
2	#	Listen uh, David, I, I, I want to apologize about that comment
2	#	Oh ya, This is my fiance, Susan. This is David
2	#	(coming back to the table from the bathroom) Oh uh. You ready?
2	#	Oh sure, sure. You wanna be alone, sure. I understand that, you wanna a little time to think uh thing..ponder things..you know..ruminant..(chuckles) you go ahead, lotta stuff on your mind..you think things out..Think, mull, mull, do a lot of mulling. (short laugh then exits Monk's)
2	#	Jerry! Jerry! Je Jerry Jerry . The most unbelievable thing has just happened, it's too Unbelievable! I'm sitting in the coffee shop, i'm talking to Susan, were talking about shoe laces (does two guns to the head) so in walks..in walks David, right, he walks right to the table..righ I introduced him to Susan..and he says get this (laughs) he says 'boy you could do a lot better than this guy' huh right (more laughing by George, Jerry is totally just mellow and straight faced) The exact same thing that I said to him, just to get back at me just to get back at me..and then, and then she says she wants to be alone for awhile..Alone Jerry! I think that she thinks that she could do better (laughs) Do you appreciate this? Do you see the irony of this? Do you see what is going on here? What's the matter?
2	#	Is that what's hurting your appreciation for the story?
2	#	Because it's really a pretty good little story. Don't you think?
2	#	Yea
2	#	(Places the doll presumingly where it belongs on a shelf) Ya?
2	#	Ya, sure sure.

2	#	Nooooooo......
2	#	Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd would really like to be an usher at the wedding
2	#	Why not?
2	#	That was an honest mistake.
2	#	Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.
2	#	(shrugs and lights it up)
2	#	(coughs) I've always smoked.
2	#	Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave it up for a while but it was too tough. Y' know.....I got no will power.

2	#	No..
2	#	Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.

2	#	Who!!?
2	#	Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this. I have to get out of this thing.
2	#	Yeah.. They made me sick.

2	#	We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank you , thank you.
2	#	She's ahem....gone

2	#	What?
2	#	No, I-I-I-I'm good. Really.
2	#	Jerry...
2	#	(to Susan's stone) ...And then, right after the All-Star Break, we, we just swept the Orioles. Four games. In Baltimore. (adjusts necktie nervously) So... yeah.
2	#	Boy, that was awkward!
2	#	What were you saying to the Rosses over there, anyway?
2	#	What is that?
2	#	(identifying it) Wrath of Khan!
2	#	That was a hell of a thing when Spock died...
2	#	Well anyway, the, uh... the stone is up, I paid my respects, guess that's it.
2	#	I have mourned for three long months! Summer months, too! Anybody could grieve in January! It's time for George to start being George again.
2	#	Yes! Nothing says George like a movie!
2	#	George is going to the movies! (exits)
2	#	(inhales deeply) I tell you, Jerry, I'm feeling something. Something I haven't felt in a long time.
2	#	No. Autonomy, complete and total autonomy.
2	#	I wanna go to a tractor pull.
2	#	I am staying out all night!
2	#	I wanna bite into a big hunk of cheese, just bite into it like it's an apple.
2	#	What?
2	#	Who?
2	#	Dolores!
2	#	Bye, Dolores.
2	#	I thought Mulva hated you.
2	#	All the way?
2	#	Yeah, and you were engaged for like a minute, I was engaged for a year.
2	#	I'm feeling something else here, Jerry!
2	#	It's open!
2	#	(surprised) Rosses.
2	#	Well, uh... come in, come, come in. (frantically clears the couch of newspapers and crumbs)
2	#	Oh. Oh. Yeah, sure. Here. Uh, sit down. Uh, uh, cheese, there? (he grabs a suit jacket from the desk chair and puts it on)
2	#	Oh, yes, yes, yes. Very, very hard.
2	#	Yes, I agree. I hope my parents go long before I do.
2	#	Oh, that's wonderful.
2	#	Yes, inte-- h-how inte-- how integral?
2	#	(feigning excitement) Great, great. O-Oh, oh, oh, gosh. You know, it's just... my duties with the Yankees...
2	#	I can't believe this is happening.
2	#	(feigning happiness) The second I see him.
2	#	Hey. How's your day, good?
2	#	So uh... Wrath of Khan, huh?
2	#	What was that line again? Something about finding your way in a shadow?
2	#	That's it. That's the line... (squirts mustard into Jerry's coffee and stirs it) ...that destroyed my life.
2	#	The Rosses have started up a foundation, Jerry, and I have to sit on the board of directors.
2	#	Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!
2	#	Don't you see? I'm back in.
2	#	Yes!
2	#	KHAN!
2	#	(startled) Oh!
2	#	Wink.
2	#	Wyck.
2	#	Oh. I know they have some monies.
2	#	So, if Susan and I had... I mean, if the envelopes hadn't, uh... then we--
2	#	And now?
2	#	This townhouse?
2	#	And now?
2	#	Not.
2	#	You know, it really can't.
2	#	Would I have had access to that?
2	#	And now?
2	#	(anticipating the answer) Not.
2	#	Hello?
2	#	My story?
2	#	Uh, excuse me, Wyck. Uh, are we, uh, almost done here?
2	#	(remorsefully) I can't go.
2	#	You want me to find a poem about Susan? May she rest in peace?!
2	#	I like, uh...(mutters something unintelligible under his breath.)
2	#	(mutters it again)
2	#	Yes!
2	#	He did it right as he said "her unfortunate accident."
2	#	Jerry, a throat-clear is a non-verbal implication of doubt - he thinks I killed Susan!
2	#	What time is it?
2	#	Right now?
2	#	Oh, the bookstore girl. How's that goin'?
2	#	Where's Elaine?
2	#	What's with all these people having babies?
2	#	Yeah! Right!
2	#	No, I did not! (They exit the coffee shop.)
2	#	Do you really think I'm wrong about this Wyck guy?
2	#	Jerry Lewis?
2	#	That's pretty paranoid.
2	#	I like it!
2	#	Where are all the poetry magazines?
2	#	Yes. The New Yorker.
2	#	I, uh, should have a poem very soon now.
2	#	No, no, not really. Ever since Susan passed on, I have good days and bad. (Turns the briefcase towards the woman on his left.) Some days, I'm haunted by one word - why. Why Susan? Why wasn't it me licking those invitations? Why am I still here? Well, I gotta run. (Gets up and leaves the meeting.)
2	#	Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.
2	#	Five minutes. What the hell happened here?
2	#	I have to rewind it first. (George presses the rewind button on the tape recorder. He and Jerry stand there, waiting impatiently as it rewinds.) Alright, alright.
2	#	Stopped dead.
2	#	I don't know. (George sits down at the table. Kramer enters.)
2	#	Why can't I stay?
2	#	Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay. (Kramer grabs the back of George's chair, drags him out into the hallway and closes the door.)
2	#	Yes! Yes, I heard the 'squink'!
2	#	It's baffling, isn't it?
2	#	They would never tell me, Elaine. First of all, they probably think that I killed Susan. Besides, I don't even think they like me. (Jerry comes over to the table.)
2	#	And you really believe this guy doesn't want to have kids.
2	#	Elaine, I once told a woman that I coined the phrase, "Pardon my French."
2	#	I once told a woman that I really enjoy spending time with my family.
2	#	This is a crude mock-up of the conference room. 1/14th scale.
2	#	Yesterday, took the day off. (Picks up a red Power Ranger action figure from the model and pretends it's him.) Now, from the time I left the room...
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Okay. That's what we know.
2	#	Well, yeah.
2	#	I don't know if you're ready for it.
2	#	I believe that I am about to become the target of a systematic process of intimidation and manipulation, the likes of which you have never -
2	#	I'm not through here, Jerry. (Picks up the model of the conference room.) I'm gonna keep on investigating. This thing is like an onion. The more layers you peel, the more it stinks. (Pam enters, George leaves.)
2	#	There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again. There are people in this room who think they can destroy other people's property and get away with it. Well, let me tell you something about those people. They weren't counting on this brain! And this tape recorder.
2	#	You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out..."Dear God!" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.
2	#	Alright, then. We've gotten to the bottom of that.
2	#	...he embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
2	#	No, it's a Newman. Well, I gotta run. (Smiles, pats his briefcase and exits.)
2	#	Fine.
2	#	I gotta go zoo. I feel like I could set more of my own schedule.
2	#	I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..
2	#	But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.
2	#	W--then I'm pretty much where I am now. At least I got to take a ride on a spaceship.
2	#	Kramer, trust me, this is the best bathroom in midtown!
2	#	(Anyway,) on the left--exquisite marble! High ceilings. An' a flush, like a jet engine! (imitates sound) Ha ha!
2	#	You sure?
2	#	Wow. Nice.
2	#	(considers, but got into elevator) Won't work.
2	#	(wry) He knows.
2	#	Hnn! Let me see that.
2	#	(still looking at that picture) You know if I told my engagement story to that receptionist, but told her this, was my fiance..
2	#	Don't you see. Women like that are like, members of a secret tribe living in a forbidden city. People like me have not been inside in thousands of years.. But with this, it's like I've already been with one of her own! My hands been stamped! I come and go as I please!
2	#	(getting up) Can I keep this?
2	#	(absently leaving with it) Thanks.
2	#	Hi. I'm ah, I'm here to see a Mr. Art Vandelay..
2	#	(taking out wallet) Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh! (has conveniently dropped the photo into her view)
2	#	(humble) Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fiance, Susan. May she rest in peace.
2	#	(shaking hands) I'm George.
2	#	Hey, she wants me to dress uh "smart casual." What uh, what is that?
2	#	Right. Bye.
2	#	This is a fantastic place! I always thought it was a meat packing plant!
2	#	Oh! Modelling! What's that like? Fun? Ha ha. (to self in head) Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
2	#	You know, I used to love Paris. My uh, dead Fiance, Susan.. (opening wallet) In fact I. think I, I may have a picture of her..
2	#	(delighted) Jerry? It was incredible! Models! As far as the eye could see!
2	#	Yes. The legends are true.
2	#	I'm not! I'm inside the walls!
2	#	Flame on!
2	#	Hello? Amanda. Hi, yes. Listen. You know, I'm thinkin', we might just be better of bein' friends. Yeah. Yeah, you know what, I can't even really talk about it right now. Bye-bye. (hangs up) (happy with himself, but then sees the burned up photo) No! No!
2	#	(frantic) Jerry! Jerry, muh--muh--my hair-dryer ruined the picture! An' I need another one or I can't get back into the forbidden city!
2	#	Jerry! I need you to get another picture of man-hands. I'm beggin' you!
2	#	Yes! Yes, all right--anything!
2	#	(quiet, desperate) Maybe she can get me another picture of man-hands. (calling) Elaine!
2	#	Elaine, I got to have another picture of Gillian.
2	#	Elaine? (she turns, sighing) Can I come?
2	#	Hi. George.
2	#	Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to come here all the time with my fiance, back when it was a meat-packing plant. Ha. Here's her picture. (hands her a magazine page)
2	#	Huh?
2	#	Ha! Heh.
2	#	But it--eh.. It was here, I'm tellin' you, an' w--w--it was really here! The, there was, a, bar, and a, an' a dance floor..
2	#	Party?
2	#	Food?
2	#	Bar?
2	#	George?
2	#	How could I possibly interfere?
2	#	(Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla?
2	#	Hi ah, My name is George.
2	#	No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.
2	#	So...
2	#	Sweet Fancy Moses!
2	#	Food was good.
2	#	Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
2	#	It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
2	#	What, you mean you know about this?
2	#	Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.
2	#	Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO.
2	#	During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy.
2	#	So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
2	#	With extreme prejudice.
2	#	No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
2	#	I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
2	#	Yes ... yes, yes
2	#	Okay, the point is made.
2	#	No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?
2	#	Yeah, she's a sweet ride.
2	#	Maybe.
2	#	Guess not.
2	#	I didn't do nothin'.
2	#	Lighten up.
2	#	Yo, Anna.
2	#	(Ironing) You don't wanna know.
2	#	What, wha, what're you talkin' about?
2	#	Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!
2	#	Pick it up, pick it up!
2	#	Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)
2	#	You are ruinin' everything.
2	#	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed.
2	#	I'm a bad man!
2	#	Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?
2	#	Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over.
2	#	Did you say dangerous?
2	#	I'm a bootlegger.
2	#	I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!
2	#	I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
2	#	(Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
2	#	Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters)
2	#	Oh my God.
2	#	Ow! Dad...
2	#	Thanks.
2	#	Ohhhhhh
2	#	Smile
2	#	I meet this women, Sheila. She works down at the one hour photo pace. She's got this incredible smile. Like she's got extra teeth or something
2	#	Hey check this out. I go to pick up my pictures and she says " I hope you got that mustard stain out of your shirt."
2	#	Don't you see. She's looking at my pictures.
2	#	That's got nothing to do with it.
2	#	Yesssss.
2	#	Why don't you find a doctor that doesn't know your difficult.
2	#	Smile.
2	#	Why did you refuse the package. Everybody loves a package.
2	#	What do you think it's a bomb?
2	#	Oh the ego on you.
2	#	Who's going to bomb you. An airline for all the stupid little peanut jokes.
2	#	Hey. There is a couple of people that wouldn't mind having me out of the way.
2	#	Hey. Check these out. I just picked them up from Sheila. She must have loved these.
2	#	I know. I just sort of leaned on it so it would look like it was mine.
2	#	No. He was fine with it. Check that out.
2	#	Wax Museum.
2	#	Oh. What is this?
2	#	This must be Sheila from the photo place.
2	#	She must have slipped it in here.
2	#	Photo store Sheila.
2	#	All right. I will see you boys later.
2	#	To ask her out.
2	#	What game?
2	#	No good?
2	#	Oh, I don't know.
2	#	Well why don't you get a hold of it and change what you don't like.
2	#	I am in and out of my personnel file at work all the time.
2	#	Hey. I've kept the same job for more than two years. It's not luck. Elaine, have you ever sent a racy photograph of yourself to anyone?
2	#	Oh yeah the nipple. But besides that. How did you feel about Kramer's work?
2	#	So it was a good experience.
2	#	Nice.
2	#	Where's Kramer?
2	#	Personal matter.
2	#	Tell him to open it.
2	#	Elaine said your pretty good at this stuff.
2	#	You don't have your own camera.
2	#	I feel fat.
2	#	Well do you want me to take it off?
2	#	Do you think it would be better if I did?
2	#	ALL RIGHT!!
2	#	So I really liked the pictures I picked up here yesterday.
2	#	And here's a roll that I think you may enjoy.
2	#	Shall we say an hour.
2	#	Can't find them. That's marvelous. The dance continues.
2	#	And maybe we could go out and do something.
2	#	Hi.
2	#	I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.
2	#	I think that's one of mine.
2	#	Can we go now?
2	#	OH MY GOD!!!
2	#	Listen Sheila it's not what you think. I put my trust into the wrong person. He said the key word was tasteful.
2	#	SHEILA!!!
2	#	I still don't understand this. Abby has a mentor?
2	#	Is there any money involved?
2	#	So what's in it for the mentor?
2	#	Pssh. Would the protg pick up stuff for the mentor?
2	#	Laundry? Dry cleaning?
2	#	Alright. Listen, I gotta get some reading done. You mind if I do this here? I can't concentrate in my apartment.
2	#	Yeah. Steinbrenner wants everyone in the front office to give a lecture in their area of business expertise.
2	#	I guess it's on my resume.
2	#	You know what? I can't do this. I can't read books anymore; books on tape have ruined me, Jerry. I need that nice voice. This book has *my* voice. I hate my voice.
2	#	You can't, it's a textbook.
2	#	Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, I noticed that you have a textbook on tape. May I ask where you got that?
2	#	I tell ya, I am hooked on these books on tape.
2	#	I take an eye test; I flunk it, the next thing you know I am swinging to the sweet sounds of risk management.
2	#	What's she like? Impressive?
2	#	Bania?
2	#	What did you have?
2	#	Marsala?
2	#	Thank you.
2	#	Dad.
2	#	What are you doing here?
2	#	My dad was a cook during the Korean War. Something very bad happened, ever since you can't get him near a kitchen.
2	#	Oh yeah, but that has nothing to do with it.
2	#	Nothing at all.
2	#	You're a very handsome man, by the way.
2	#	This guy sounds just like me.
2	#	This is horrible.
2	#	(banging the recorder) Stop it! Stop it!
2	#	I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.
2	#	No problem.
2	#	I'll make time, because Abby, I was once like you; wide-eyed, naive, I didn't know the first thing about a subject as fundamental as risk management.
2	#	I'll tell you what, why don't you read this book and let's just see if you can explain it to me.
2	#	Okay.
2	#	Ovaltine. Have you ever had this stuff? Why is it called Ovaltine?
2	#	They should call it round tine. You know what I'm talking about.
2	#	(pulls a face) I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.
2	#	What checks?
2	#	Look at all of those! You're rich!
2	#	He's giving you furniture? Who is this guy?
2	#	(dryly) You're on that list.
2	#	Alright, I gotta go home and open up with the house for the carpet cleaners. You know they're doing my whole place for twenty-five dollars.
2	#	So? For a twenty-five dollar cleaning, I can listen to some pointless blather.
2	#	(smiling expectantly) Here it comes.
2	#	(signs) Sorry. (expectant) You're sure, uh, there isn't anything else?
2	#	(let down) So, that's it?
2	#	(melancholy) I wish that was all needed. Life can be so confusing. I..I'm searching for answers, anywhere.
2	#	(annoyed) Not a peep. They just cleaned the carpets and left. Call themselves a cult!
2	#	They could've at least tried!
2	#	Please.
2	#	How'd you hook up with these guys?
2	#	(excited) Yeah, the pilot!
2	#	(enthusiastic) And, you know, I do a lotta business with Japanese TV. They broadcast a lot of American baseball. They got an office here in New York!
2	#	(animated) It failed here! Because, here, every time you turn on a TV, all you see is four morons sitting round an apartment, whining about their dates!
2	#	(eager) So? What d'you think?
2	#	Ah. You see, the man who was the butler, uh, had gotten into a car accident with Jerry, and because he didn't have any insurance, the judge decreed that the man become Jerry's butler.
2	#	Oh, I, uh, I disagree. You've, uh, you've been living in America too long. (indicates the bag of oranges) You've forgotten what it's like to have no oranges.
2	#	(positive) Yes. From endorsing checks for the Super Terrific Happy Hour. (laughs)
2	#	(indicating the window) Kramer, it's, it's raining. They got the tarp on the field.
2	#	Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.
2	#	Are they here?
2	#	(suspicious) They haven't said anything to you, have they?
2	#	(to himself, resentful) What kind of a snobby, stuck-up, cult is this?!
2	#	(excited) Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!
2	#	(excited) Did I tell you that story's relatable?! That was a great show! That is why I'm bringing it back to NBC.
2	#	(little subdued) Nakahama Broadcast Corporation.
2	#	But now I have my own market research. Actual Japanese viewers, that love the show! I'm gonna talk to Kramer.
2	#	Hey, by the way, what'd you think of Miss Yoshimura?
2	#	The network executive. You think she liked me?
2	#	Get a good night's sleep, alright fellas. (thumbs up) Big day tomorrow!
2	#	Uh. (smiles) Where's the boys?
2	#	(horrified) But that meeting starts in ten minutes!
2	#	(frantic) I'm calling Jerry.
2	#	(panicked and rushed) Jerry! The Japanese guys had sake in the hot-tub! You gotta get 'em outta the drawers and get 'em down here, or I don't have a focus group to sell the pilot to Japanese TV!
2	#	(scream) Jerry!!
2	#	So, uh, gentlemen, do we have a deal?
2	#	(to the executives) Excuse me. Did you hire the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
2	#	Mr Wilhelm? Wha..what're you doing here?
2	#	(incredulity) Him you brainwashed! (angry shout) What's he got that I don't have?!
2	#	(urgent) Mr Wilhelm, listen. You've been abducted! Please, Mr Wilhelm, you gotta listen to me!
2	#	Dollar Eighty-Nine. Why is this a dollar eighty-nine? Why is there no haggling in this country?
2	#	Not me. Everything should be negotiable. (he picks up a container of fruit)
2	#	Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta. All starches are a scam.
2	#	Ahh, Excuse me, how much is this?
2	#	I'll give you a quarter.
2	#	Thirty.
2	#	Alright see? We got something there.
2	#	You know I still don't know how you can call lunch with me a business expense.
2	#	It stinks.
2	#	Hey, you like?
2	#	Really? (feeling flattered)
2	#	Elaine, huh... Peterman account?
2	#	Hey.
2	#	This hat just bottles in the heat, I -I don't even need a coat! It's unbelievable!
2	#	Ah, and I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little Marisa Tomei thing going on.
2	#	I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some errands to run.
2	#	What's the difference? You know they way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, youre hummin it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) "By Mennen!".
2	#	If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.
2	#	Oh no I'm in already come on.
2	#	So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?
2	#	What about this weekend?
2	#	OK, ah.. (George throws his keys on the table) see ya!
2	#	Oh, those, those aren't my keys.
2	#	Oh. Ha. They are my keys, how weird. (laughs)
2	#	Yea bye.
2	#	(sings) Co-stan-za. (like "By Mennen")
2	#	I left it at Heather's. Are these alive? (pounding on glass display)
2	#	Alright, alright, I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat back, I will get a second date. Ha ha ha. Now watch the magic.
2	#	(clears throat) Heather Hi, it's George Costanza.
2	#	Ah, listen ah, I don't mean to bother you but ah, silly me, I- I think I may have left my hat in your apartment. So ah, I thought I'd just come by later and pick it up.
2	#	I- I'm pretty sure I left it eh, behind the cushion of the chair ... accidentally.
2	#	Ah, a, You know what, maybe I'll just come ... umm, yummm (stammering)
2	#	Hi.
2	#	Well not really...
2	#	Ah... (quietly)
2	#	Well that makes sense.
2	#	Good to see you again.
2	#	She's bluffing...
2	#	... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.
2	#	Oh I don't know. Check this out.
2	#	Yep, this one for our side!
2	#	Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?
2	#	She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.
2	#	I've looked at that, seems unlikely.
2	#	Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.
2	#	So how do you want to do this?
2	#	So you - you really don't have my hat?
2	#	Uh, le - let's go do, something.
2	#	Oh that's eh, that's a sandwich.
2	#	...ah (picks up the bag) Damn salami.
2	#	That damn delicatessen that - that is last time they screw up one of my orders.
2	#	Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over the Andes.
2	#	We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?
2	#	So fast? What about me?
2	#	Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.
2	#	Well I would eat you.
2	#	I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. I'm your best friend.
2	#	Thank you.
2	#	No.
2	#	With me or in general?
2	#	Nucleosis.
2	#	No, no, pff...
2	#	Yeah, six weeks.
2	#	I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.
2	#	I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.
2	#	Like us. (Elaine enters)
2	#	So it's just mono.
2	#	No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
2	#	I think. (Pause as they all look down)
2	#	They asked you to do career day?
2	#	Oh with all due respect, I went there too, and I work for a team that just won the World Series.
2	#	It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking all night.
2	#	you know, just by conversing, you can really learn a lot about a person.
2	#	You got bumped from career day?
2	#	Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You can't smoke in here.
2	#	What is Pericles?
2	#	Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
2	#	What is Borax?
2	#	What is Tungsten or Wolfram?
2	#	No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with Louise.
2	#	You think?
2	#	Oh my God. I just remembered where I left my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)
2	#	Of course. Absolute zero!
2	#	I stopped having sex.
2	#	Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home run) It's not complicated.
2	#	George Costanza, assistant to the traveling secretary.
2	#	Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you wanna win some ball games?
2	#	In six games.
2	#	Nine minutes.
2	#	Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.
2	#	Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese accent?
2	#	Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
2	#	Eh, don't mention it.
2	#	Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've picked it up.
2	#	I told her I would have to think about it.
2	#	I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.
2	#	Simple joke from a simple man.
2	#	Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.
2	#	Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle the eye.
2	#	You know, Louise. I think you'll find this amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--
2	#	I used to share that same outlook. But now, I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.
2	#	What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress approaches)
2	#	Si, por favor.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	I got lost on the way over.
2	#	What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head like antennae) Take me to your leader.
2	#	No, the Portuguese waitress.
2	#	I calculated my odds of ever getting together with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.
2	#	No, no. I'm not going on.
2	#	Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.
2	#	Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out!
2	#	I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.
2	#	(Definite) Oh yeah.
2	#	You know what? it's better than Elaine's, too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)
2	#	(Stops) Oh right, the blind date.
2	#	Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll take you two minutes.
2	#	(Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with the walk-in closet. (Smiles)
2	#	(Laughs as they leave) It's working already! (Both exit)
2	#	(Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves her off)
2	#	Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball
2	#	(Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it to me.
2	#	(Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)
2	#	I remember.. (Leaves)
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) The tenant association made me give it to this guy because he was an Andrea Doria survivor..
2	#	(Talking about his would-be apartment) You could fit 15 people in that bathroom..
2	#	How do you know?
2	#	51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!
2	#	That's no tragedy! How many people do you lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that book? (Starts walking tward the door. Kramer grabs his food, and follows)
2	#	What's with the dog?
2	#	Oh..
2	#	A vet?
2	#	So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take dog medicine?
2	#	Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were on the Andrea Doria.
2	#	I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal, huh, Clarence? (Laughs)
2	#	Well, all vacations have to end eventually.
2	#	(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?
2	#	(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!
2	#	So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!
2	#	(Interested) I should!
2	#	I could go bumper to bumper with any one else on this planet!
2	#	Nah, I guess I should really get moving on this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)
2	#	(On the other line) Hey.
2	#	Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.
2	#	Yeah, the tenant association has decided to hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll see ya.
2	#	So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..
2	#	(Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad.
2	#	(Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think I'm pretty clear on it.
2	#	I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)
2	#	It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.
2	#	They're making their decision today.
2	#	Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?
2	#	What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you the apartment?!
2	#	Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged forehead)
2	#	That's why they gave you the apartment?
2	#	Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!
2	#	Fantastic day! Fantastic!
2	#	(laughs - hehe) Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.
2	#	Then, I'm at The Foundation...
2	#	Sometimes, once in a while.
2	#	No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, they made this large donation, to a women's prison, and I get to go down there and check it out.
2	#	Yeah-hah!
2	#	Nothing really, you know...just eh, stroll around the cell blocks, maybe eh, take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey eh, you know you got a bounced check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?
2	#	I noticed you eh, chose the eh "clowns with balloons" check design.
2	#	Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about guts. (Points to his head.) This is guts.
2	#	These are not "scraps." These are historic remains of a once Great Society of Hair.
2	#	Tennis courts? W-w-what about the yard? Where do they have the gang fights?
2	#	Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?
2	#	Thanks, Warden.
2	#	Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. (Notices another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.) So you two uh, shop at the same store, (hu)?
2	#	Oh my God...You're in jail? (Celia nods.) That is so cool!
2	#	Well...not "out." She's a prisoner.
2	#	Why not?
2	#	That was different!
2	#	Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the time. I have relatively no competition. An-and you know how you live in fear of the pop-in?
2	#	Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really well...
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Embezzlement.
2	#	Allow me. Why?
2	#	Yeah. I had a great time.
2	#	The whole hour just flew by. (laughs - hehe) (Begins cleaning up the table.)
2	#	Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four days.
2	#	Of course you will. (quick chuckle). You're the best. (with a light fist motion across her chin)
2	#	How're the folks?
2	#	So? Movie tonight?
2	#	I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!
2	#	The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with this now.
2	#	That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
2	#	Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something nice.
2	#	Parole! (Feigning joy) That's dynamite!
2	#	Celia's up for parole.
2	#	What?
2	#	She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. (Rubs his forehead.) Talking...
2	#	Heh, haa. And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.
2	#	It's not the same.
2	#	Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.
2	#	Plans. Schemes. She ah, she keeps talking about getting back together with her old friends, you know - "the gang," as she likes to call them (chuckles), you know. Yeah, they're eh, they're hatching something, you can count on that.
2	#	No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.
2	#	You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances beyond this perimeter - (points at Kurt's head with a pen) - then you won't be Kurt anymore.
2	#	Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. (There's a knock at the door.) Excuse me.
2	#	Celia? W-w-what are you doing here?
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Is that good?
2	#	Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows up at the door!
2	#	Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime -
2	#	Oh, hey, sorry I'm late.
2	#	Sorry I'm late.
2	#	She didn't want to come, she-she's not really into sports.
2	#	Where's the tamale guy?
2	#	Uh, excuse me. Uh, pound of Arabian mocha java, please.
2	#	I'm going to the bathroom.
2	#	Oh Oh, here, lemme uh...
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Mmm.
2	#	You see what just happened here?
2	#	She treated me to the Arabian mocha java.
2	#	She's stickin' it to me that she makes more money than me.
2	#	No, not nice. She's stickin' it to me.
2	#	(worked up) Stickin' it to me, Jerry.
2	#	(angry) Stickin' it!
2	#	So you're buying the car back for your parents?
2	#	Your parents'll never let you do it.
2	#	What kind of money you think your parents have?
2	#	I bet they have more money than mine.
2	#	You think?
2	#	Never.
2	#	Nothing.
2	#	Nowhere.
2	#	How much money d'you think they have?
2	#	(excited) You're saying I stand to inherit three hundred thousand dollars, is that what you're saying?!
2	#	Twenty years? That long?
2	#	Fortunately, yes.
2	#	I have an aunt that died at seven.
2	#	Aunt Baby.
2	#	I been, uh, thinking about the family. Tell me, uh, about Aunt Baby.
2	#	(glances upwards) Yeah. Uhm, why did she die so young?
2	#	Is that common in our family?
2	#	I guess you two are the lucky ones.
2	#	(oozing fake sincerity) Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.
2	#	Oh, he'll be here. By the way, Elaine, (reaches under the table and brings out a large coffee machine) thank you for laying out for the Arabian mocha java.
2	#	Hey look, he's back.
2	#	Mom? Dad?
2	#	Wh..what're you doing here?
2	#	What?
2	#	(pointing outside) Why is there a Cadillac parked in front of the house?
2	#	You bought that?
2	#	What the hell is going on here?
2	#	(dread) Oh god.
2	#	Wait a minute. (astonished) You're thinking of moving to Florida again?!
2	#	(pointing out the positive) But happy.
2	#	Obviously.
2	#	No, no. No, no, no. (determined) We're staying on me. We haven't solved anything yet.
2	#	What d'you mean, let 'em go? They're spending all my money.
2	#	(upset) Could you put a little thought into this? Jerry's gone, you could humour me. He humours me.
2	#	You know what I do at the Yankees, when one of these old guys is breathing down my neck?
2	#	You schedule a late meeting.
2	#	These old guys, they're up at 4 a.m., by two thirty they're wiped. (animated) How did we get back onto you?!
2	#	(shouted after Elaine) You know, I got nothing outta this!
2	#	Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say...
2	#	(attempting sincerity) As much as I'd like to see the two of you living it up in a warm, tropical, setting, I, I would just miss you too much. (smiling) So, I've decided, I want you to stay.
2	#	(crestfallen) But you said it was my call.
2	#	(animated) You're letting him have a woman over?!
2	#	(Jerry-style) That's a shame.
2	#	(innocent) What?
2	#	(relishing) Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. Delicious.
2	#	I am. The folks are twelve hundred miles away. (gleeful) I'm basking in the buffer zone. (looks for the waitress) 'Nother piece of pie here!
2	#	(through a mouthful of shrimp) Well, why don't we just put a monitor in his skybox?
2	#	(angry, to himself) The ocean called. Running outta shrimp. Outta shrimp! (a thought occurs) Oh! Yes! That's what I shoulda said! (frustrated shout) Dammit!
2	#	Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then, I said to him, 'Oh yeah? Well, the jerk store called, and they're running outta you.'
2	#	(confessing) Well, actually, I thought it up on the way over here.
2	#	No. No it's not. You don't know this guy. It woulda been so sweet.
2	#	Right.
2	#	Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you, my friends.
2	#	I got another meeting with Reilly. A whole new audience, and I bet I can get him to try that line again.
2	#	Listen to the comeback. (pleased) 'Oh yeah? Well the jerk store called. They're running outta you.'
2	#	(worked up) Wha...You gotta be kidding me?!
2	#	(confused) What does that mean?
2	#	(frustrated) No. No, no, no. You're not helping me.
2	#	(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.
2	#	(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!
2	#	Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?
2	#	(surprise) What? I..I didn't hear about that.
2	#	So concerned was he, that word of his poor tennis skills might leak out, he chose to offer you his wife as some sort of mediaeval sexual payola?
2	#	(hopeful) So, details?
2	#	Because of society, right?
2	#	Reilly is no longer with the club. (getting up) You believe that?
2	#	Yeah, I'm gonna let it go.
2	#	(animated) Are you insane? Jerk store, woulda smoked that guy! Smoked him, I say.
2	#	(frustrated) Ohh, I wanted to see that. (waves his arms in frustration) Thanks. Thanks a lot.
2	#	(sitting) So, guess where Mr 'Ocean phoned' turned up? He's working for Firestone, in Akron, Ohio.
2	#	Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.
2	#	Don't you understand? It's not about him. To have a line as perfect as 'jerk store' and to never use it. I, I couldn't live with myself.
2	#	(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!
2	#	(waving apologetically) Not you.
2	#	(through a mouthful) Long as they don't throw 'em on the field. (laughs) Huhu. (indicating dish) Help yourself to some shrimp, I brought enough for everybody.
2	#	Well, you never know. (picks up more shrimp) Let's see how many I can fit in my mouth.
2	#	(standing) Oh yeah, Reilly? (smugly) Well, the jerk store called. They're running outta you
2	#	Yeah? Well, I had sex with your wife.
2	#	My wife's in a coma.' Yeah? Well, the life support machine called and...
2	#	(shouts) Wait! Yes! That's what I should've said! (frustration) D'ohh!
2	#	(cocky laughter) Huh haha! (shouts) You're meat, Reilly! You just screwed yourself! (laughter) Ha ha!
2	#	So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was her birthday?
2	#	Is she socially awkward?
2	#	Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.
2	#	Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.
2	#	Nope!
2	#	Nope! (Starts heading for the door)
2	#	Noo!
2	#	(Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine I say! (Leaves)
2	#	Quick, what's your favorite animal?
2	#	(Disappointed) A frog?
2	#	(Annoyed) Frog is wrong.
2	#	(Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? It'd save you a lot of trouble.
2	#	(Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.
2	#	(Reading) I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.
2	#	so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.
2	#	Who's your favorite chess player?
2	#	Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, again?
2	#	(Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. (They both sit back down) What do you want to do when you grow up?
2	#	So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about this, then shakes it off)
2	#	Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
2	#	(Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone for the scholarship.
2	#	I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes sports.. watches T.V..
2	#	(Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this he's into architecture.
2	#	Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that meaty part of the curve - not showing off, not falling behind.
2	#	I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized tests..
2	#	Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.
2	#	(Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.
2	#	(Mutters) No, it's not.
2	#	(Irritated) It's called a T-square.
2	#	I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh and blood. Like my father.. my father's father before him.
2	#	You're spending the weekend with Ellen?
2	#	(To Kramer) You want to start?
2	#	Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.
2	#	(Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career? Things will pick up.
2	#	I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!
2	#	Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!
2	#	Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps out of nowhere, surrounding George)
2	#	Oh.. nice.
2	#	What about architect, Steven?
2	#	Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now, what'd you do?
2	#	(Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna do to me?!
2	#	You mean, like, a former member?
2	#	Hey, Van B. Boys.
2	#	Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up on one of your own.
2	#	Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid gestures)
2	#	(Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
2	#	Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)
2	#	Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds walk by) Seinfelds!
2	#	Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. I'll give it back to you later.
2	#	Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me your wallet, or I'll spill your guts right here on the street!
2	#	Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!
2	#	(Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he backs off)
2	#	Hey.
2	#	(sitting) Newww tuxedo. For the Pinstripe Ball. Steinbrenner is throwing a huge party at Tavern on the Green, heh!
2	#	(resentfully dampened) It's not a prom. It's a Ball.
2	#	Yes, of course I'm taking Allison. This woman is genetically engineered to go to a ball. Tall, blonde, lithe--
2	#	Live?
2	#	An' wait'll you see the dress that she's got. It's backless! Uh?! I'm finally gonna make a Great Entrance!
2	#	Elaine, when a woman makes a Ball Entrance.. she twirls.
2	#	She'll Twirl.
2	#	That is what Mr. Steinbrenner wants. He wants, everyone, ta, twirl around.
2	#	Hey! Uh--listen--did you get your--uh--boss's Knick ticket, for Kramer?
2	#	Oh! Great!
2	#	Woo! Courtside! (mock-snide) Is that the best you could do? Ha ha!
2	#	What?
2	#	(pause) Uh-oh.
2	#	She doesn't Want to talk, she needs to talk.
2	#	Who would Want to. She tried to end it with me, Jerry.
2	#	I told her I was out o' soda, I went out to get some, an' I never went back.
2	#	Yeah, I slept at my parents' house.
2	#	Ha! (snort) Can you believe it? (amused) I'm supposed to be havin' lunch with her right now at Pomodoro.
2	#	So? What'm I gonna do?
2	#	No. I like the ball! This is my One Chance to make a Great Entrance! My whole life! I have never made a great entrance!
2	#	(admitting) All right..
2	#	(resolved) Why not. (determined) If she can't find me, she can't break up with me. And, if we're still goin' out, she has to gooo to the ballll.
2	#	Yeah, yeah, right here. (hands it to him)
2	#	(clipping on shades) Ha.. She'll have to find me first. (leaving)
2	#	(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
2	#	(answers phone, good mood) Hey.
2	#	No, I can't. She knows I go there. It's not secure. (the call waiting beeps) Hey, I got another call comin' in. I gotta let the machine get it. Bye. (hangs up)
2	#	(on tape, singing) "Believe it or not, George, isn't at home, please leave a mes-saaage at the beep. I must be out or I'd pick up the pho-one. Where could I be? Believe it or not, I'm not hooome." (beep)
2	#	(to phone) Hi, Allison? Oh, I guess you're not at home.. I probably should 'ave tried you at the office. Anyway, good to hear from ya, really looking forward to the ball.. (hangs up and happily chuckles) Ha ha!
2	#	So--ah, Kramer. Why'd you ask me out to dinner? (amused) An' why Pomodoro?
2	#	(quiet) Uh-oh.
2	#	Can't we discuss this?
2	#	(dismayed) I didn't even know you wanted to get serious!
2	#	(pause) Are you?
2	#	I, I can't believe this is happening!
2	#	Krama. Please.
2	#	Hi.
2	#	It's, funny runnin' into you here.
2	#	(embarrassed/self-conscious about his gut) Do I? Thanks.. You too..
2	#	(sad) Yeah! Yeah. Hey--hey you, you know.. Maybe I'll call you sometime.
2	#	(pause) What do you think, Jerry.
2	#	Krama. Open up! I--I know you're in there!
2	#	(sad) It's only four..
2	#	I--I've been, walkin' around all night.. I've been thinkin' about Allison and me.. an' you--
2	#	Please. Give me another chance.
2	#	(grateful, relieved) Thank you! I'm gonna make you both so happy!
2	#	(delighted!) Woooo!
2	#	Where's uh, where's Allison..
2	#	But you took me back.
2	#	Where are you goin'..
2	#	(afraid not) No no, no no no. You're not goin' in there.
2	#	(impatient) For her. Not for you.
2	#	All right, look--wait--wait--Krama--wait, wait a minute, you are not. You are not goin' in. Ah-ahhh!
2	#	So?
2	#	You said you grabbed it outta there real fast, right?
2	#	So I'm sure whatever germs it landed on were knocked out, and by the time the rest of them realised what was going on, you had already grabbed it out.
2	#	Was she mad?
2	#	You didn't tell her.
2	#	Finicky? Prissy? Fastidious?
2	#	Ahh, Steinbrenner gave 'em to us, in honour of Phil Rizzuto being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
2	#	Just the last few innings of a double-header.
2	#	Keys. I can't find my keys.
2	#	Have you seen 'em?
2	#	Dammit!
2	#	I got up, I was supposed to go to work, I came here instead.
2	#	I don't have a spare set. All my keys say 'do not duplicate'.
2	#	So you can't duplicate 'em.
2	#	So the plan is to secretly sterilise her mouth?
2	#	No, stings the throat. Anyway, so I was coming along here, and I felt like a piece of cake, you know? But then I thought, it's morning, I should really have a muffin. I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!
2	#	Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.
2	#	I was trying to stick the landing. (indistinct) ...was right around here.
2	#	No! No!!
2	#	No keys. And I been calling the city all day. Course there's not really a number to call if you wanna make a pothole.
2	#	I tell you this. If the real Phil Rizzuto was down there, this wouldn't be happening!
2	#	Really?
2	#	You think you could hook me up with these guys?
2	#	Seven-eight-four.
2	#	Yeah. Thanks for, thanks for coming by fellas. Eh, got a set of keys, buried in the pothole.
2	#	Just need to uh, to dig 'em up.
2	#	Nah, nah, it's uh, it's a long story. Just uh, try to get it up.
2	#	Yeah, I know that. (clears throat) Could you start, working?
2	#	(penny drops) Oh, uh, wait a minute, wait a minute. (snorts) Is this about money?
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Oh, I was uh, I was waiting downstairs for the jackhammer, thought I'd drop by.
2	#	Yeah. I got 'em down to fifty bucks. I just have to do all the jackhammering myself.
2	#	Ow!
2	#	...stop pushing. (to Elaine) Kramer spilled ammonia.
2	#	Ah, I've had everything on the menu. Uh, surprise me.
2	#	(bemused) Really?
2	#	(pointing to himself) Like me?
2	#	(confused, to himself) Like me? But how?
2	#	Yes, yes, I am.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Hey. You ready?
2	#	Jerry, figure this out. I'm in the coffee shop, and this beautiful girl I could never even talk to, mistakes me for her boyfriend.
2	#	(incredulous) I look just like him. I. Me. (flings his arms out) This! This is what her boyfriend looks like. How is that possible?
2	#	(wondering) Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he and I are exactly the same, except for one minor, yet crucial, detail. You never know.
2	#	Maybe it's some small thing I could change. Like a moustache. Or wearing a top hat, or a monocle, or a..or a cane.
2	#	(pointedly) She could do a lot worse than Mr Peanut, my friend.
2	#	(smiling) Uh, hi. Uhm, remember me? I..I'm the guy who looks like Neil?
2	#	Huh-Hi. (looks around a little) Uhm, is Neil here?
2	#	Oh, that's too bad. I kinda wanted to meet him, seeing as how we look so similar.
2	#	(disappointment) Oh. Course not.
2	#	(smiling) Listen, I..I..I don't mean to seem forward...
2	#	...but is there any way that I could possibly have Neil's phone number?
2	#	You know, you could've just given me Neil's number. You..you didn't have to take me out to dinner.
2	#	Does Neil like to eat a big breakfast?
2	#	(looking at his watch) I really should get going. Y'know, I..I wanna be home in case Neil calls.
2	#	(hurried) I'll see you.
2	#	(animated) Some guy. Some guy? Neil! I have got to find out how he could get a girl like Danielle.
2	#	(surprised) So, I'm Neil? How did I do that?
2	#	I'm gonna go meet Danielle. (grabs his coat) There's a new Neil in town! (triumphant laughter) Hahaha!
2	#	(interested) Really?
2	#	(smug) Ah, I guess I showed Neil who's Neil.
2	#	(little worried) Coffee? (thinks) I can beat that. Move in with me.
2	#	(smiles) Beats the hell out of coffee.
2	#	I gotta stay one step ahead of Neil.
2	#	(animated) Then I'm going to Mars!
2	#	(tormented) Aw, shut up Jerry! Just shut up!
2	#	What, to see the old guy?
2	#	How old's the son?
2	#	What is with this family?
2	#	So?
2	#	Danielle. Where's Neil? (indicating the bed) Is this him?
2	#	(to Danielle) Whose cane is this?
2	#	(to himself) A cane. I knew it. (to Neil) So, we meet at last. I admire your skills, Mr Peanut.
2	#	Well, Danielle, (digs in his pocket) we should get going. I got a key made for you.
2	#	(shocked) What?
2	#	(animated) N..no, no. You can't leave me. (frantic) Marry me! I'll burn myself. I'll burn my parents!
2	#	Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.
2	#	I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.
2	#	Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. I'll see ya'.
2	#	Jerry, look at my eyes.
2	#	Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.
2	#	Conrad, is it?
2	#	Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?
2	#	It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work after dinner, do you?
2	#	Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, uh, for an alarm clock?
2	#	Like this.
2	#	Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?
2	#	Blanket.
2	#	Maybe like this.
2	#	Yeah, like that.
2	#	That is what I want.
2	#	Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better than my bed at home.
2	#	Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.
2	#	That's what I want.
2	#	Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.
2	#	Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. You got to help[ me.
2	#	Jerry, . . .
2	#	Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away.
2	#	?? get away??
2	#	Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
2	#	Just CALL!
2	#	I'm sorry sir.
2	#	What?
2	#	Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What the hell happened here?
2	#	Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.
2	#	Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?
2	#	Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
2	#	Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.
2	#	??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.
2	#	FINE? WHAT SIZE?
2	#	SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!
2	#	I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
2	#	Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call back here.
2	#	Let me put that on speaker phone.
2	#	??? sir.
2	#	You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the phone.
2	#	Finished.
2	#	Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.
2	#	Hi Connie, Jerry around?
2	#	There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
2	#	So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.
2	#	I was naked.
2	#	Really? What happened?
2	#	Is "yada yada" bad?
2	#	She is succinct.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Yeah, dentist of the stars.
2	#	Hey, where you just at the health club?
2	#	What a succinct story.
2	#	Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.
2	#	Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...
2	#	Yada yada yada...
2	#	Oh, you're in here.
2	#	I knew you had an appointment.
2	#	I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole life story. (Picks up dental tool)
2	#	Hey, what this thing? Whew!
2	#	Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?
2	#	Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)
2	#	Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.
2	#	Yada.
2	#	Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.
2	#	Really?
2	#	Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)
2	#	Well it was a helluva yada yada.
2	#	All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. Just give me the full story.
2	#	Tell me about the free facial.
2	#	Which one?
2	#	Very good. Go on.
2	#	What's that?
2	#	Shoplifting.
2	#	Jerry, I gotta talk to you.
2	#	She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and Julie enter)
2	#	So you're on the speed dial?
2	#	What number?
2	#	Wha! You know, it's a pain to change that. You gotta lift up that plastic thing with a pen.
2	#	Hey, so get this. I get a call this morning from one of the Mets front office guys. They wanna take me out to lunch.
2	#	(smiling) I'm on a winning ball club, Jerry. They probably wanna pick my brains.
2	#	(thoughtful) I have no idea.
2	#	(slightly worried) You know, I'm starting to get a little nervous about this lunch.
2	#	(surprise) Head of scouting?
2	#	(playing it cool) I'm still here.
2	#	So you're talking...
2	#	So, you need me to get fired.
2	#	(jokingly) You are still paying for this lunch?
2	#	...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.
2	#	There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.
2	#	Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'
2	#	Ehh. (nostalgic) Remember that summer at Dairy Queen where I cooled my feet in the soft-serve machine?
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	So?
2	#	What, she's ranking you?
2	#	What is a barometer exactly?
2	#	Sorry I'm late, but look what I found in the Yankee Hall of Pride display case.
2	#	Is it? (reaches into bag)
2	#	Huh, strawberries, anyone? (eats a strawberry) Ah, that's good. Ooh, juicy this time of year.
2	#	Gotta get the good ones.
2	#	Oh, that's bad. That's bad.
2	#	You wanted to see me, sir?
2	#	Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.
2	#	Never thought I'd fail at failing.
2	#	(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.
2	#	(hopeful) Everything?
2	#	You really think so?
2	#	Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!
2	#	(pleased) I know.
2	#	Jerry. I can't get fired.
2	#	Attention Steinbrenner and front-office morons! Your triumphs mean nothing. You all stink. You can sit on it, and rotate! This is George Costanza. I fear no reprisal. Extension five-one-seven-oh.
2	#	(agitated) He's lying, sir! I'm tired of all your macho head games!
2	#	Mr Wilhelm, what was that?!
2	#	Yeah. No problem.
2	#	Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.
2	#	I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
2	#	Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
2	#	Where are you going?
2	#	Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns to a man) Can I borrow your menu?
2	#	The guy never came back.
2	#	I'm still watching them.
2	#	All right, let me ask you something When do you start to worry about ear hair?
2	#	It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty, knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this Do you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting there.
2	#	I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.
2	#	They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.
2	#	Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the bus at the port authority?
2	#	Thanks. Thanks a lot.
2	#	Well actually I'm...
2	#	Little Rock, Arkensas.
2	#	It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town visiting so there's no messy breakup
2	#	I got a hotel room.
2	#	Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?
2	#	So?
2	#	Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
2	#	Reality tour?
2	#	Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
2	#	Willie. Yeah.
2	#	Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
2	#	Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* town.
2	#	Find a job. Get an apartment.
2	#	Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.
2	#	What's desert?
2	#	He eats those?
2	#	I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography is not. Now, you Kramer are real.
2	#	But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman which is you.
2	#	2300
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.
2	#	Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting to leave)
2	#	Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.
2	#	Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.
2	#	What clothes?
2	#	(talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's room on 43rd street in my underpants.
2	#	I got to give the players most of the credit for that.
2	#	No, I don't know who was doing that.
2	#	They had a pastry cart you wouldn't believe.
2	#	She is a good waitress.
2	#	You're going to the Tony's?
2	#	Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes. 'What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?'
2	#	It's a funny observation.
2	#	Severance package...The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.
2	#	I'm really going to do something with these three months.
2	#	I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end. In that order.
2	#	I'm gonna play frolf.
2	#	Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry. Golf with a frisbee. This is gonna be my time. Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin. I proclaim this The Summer of George!
2	#	Hey, 'The White Shadow' is on...
2	#	Jerry, my vacation just started. I need a day or two to de-compress. Besides, I did plenty today.
2	#	I bought a new recliner with a fridge build right in to it.
2	#	Shadow!
2	#	Kramer?
2	#	She had a dude?
2	#	How do you know it was her dude?
2	#	Sure, dudes in this town are dime a dozen.
2	#	Or maybe, she just wanted to go to the Tony's. I tell you what; you ask her out again. No Tony, just Jerry. That way you know it he was her dude or just some dude.
2	#	All right, that's enough. I gotta go home and take a nap.
2	#	I tell you; I'm wiped.
2	#	De-compressing.
2	#	Scarsdale surprise'. That's the musical about that Scarsdale diet doctor murder.
2	#	What, Minelli's!?!
2	#	Who's that?
2	#	Hey Kramer.
2	#	How's that Tony?
2	#	Why can't we do this on the phone? What's Kramer doing now?
2	#	Kramer. Anything good in there? Any Popsicles?
2	#	(on the answering machine) Jerry, what's happening? Come on, pick up the phone.
2	#	Hey, I've done that today.
2	#	Nah, the cable's out. What's with you? You look dead.
2	#	(Laughs) Relationship intern...hey, what if two of us teamed up?
2	#	No, no...
2	#	No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?
2	#	Exactly! Because neither one of us can't handle a woman all by ourselves.
2	#	I've tried. We don't have it. But maybe the two of us, working together at full capacity, could do the job of one normal man.
2	#	Yeah, two for the 715 of Novaj pravas (?). What you're wearing the green sweater?
2	#	She doesn't like. Here is your blue one, it's her favorite. (Takes sweater out of his bag.)
2	#	Just put it on! All right now, remember she had her nails done today so remark how you like the color. And if you need me you beep me, all right. Here you go, hey, hey, hey, hey...(sprays Binaca into Jerry's mouth.) Go get'em you're a tiger!
2	#	A little notice would've helped! How many people?
2	#	I know, I know...don't skimp. Go go go go...
2	#	Hi, I need some party invitations.
2	#	About a year ago. Wedding invitations.
2	#	No complaints.
2	#	Actually, (George flips the book back to the beginning) I'll take these nice glossy ones.
2	#	Hey, frolf?
2	#	Yeah, sure.
2	#	He frolfs, he scores...(he drops one invitation on the stairs.)
2	#	Hello.
2	#	Yeah, the super glossy. The best they had.
2	#	All right, All right, keep your towel on.
2	#	It's a joke.
2	#	I slipped on the invitations...how's the towels?
2	#	With the two of us?
2	#	This was supposed to be 'The summer of George'! The summer of George.
2	#	Still a little summer left.
2	#	What is Holland?
2	#	No, that's the Netherlands.
2	#	Then who are the Dutch?
2	#	I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn star.
2	#	Well why didn't we?
2	#	What if we grew muttonchops?
2	#	Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!
2	#	(resigned) Dammit.
2	#	Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?
2	#	Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.
2	#	Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's a sad story. You through with those?
2	#	Alright, we're back in!
2	#	And you're the shark?
2	#	I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
2	#	(on the phone) Oh my God.
2	#	I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
2	#	Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.
2	#	Playground equipment.
2	#	Yeah haha.
2	#	(holding his cane) I gotta hobble. (walks out)
2	#	I got the job?
2	#	Well, no.
2	#	Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) Oh, I'm not handicapped.
2	#	Yeah, I didn't mean that.
2	#	(shocked) When do I start?
2	#	(Thomassoulo helps George get up) Yeah, what the hell.
2	#	Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They- they treat me so great. You know they think I'm handicapped, they gave me this incredible office, a great view.
2	#	Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the bathroom they gave me!
2	#	Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm just now getting the recognition for it. Name one thing I have that puts me in a position of advantage. Huh? There was a guy that worked at the Yankees-- no arms! He got more work done than I did, made more money, had a wife, a family, drove a better car than I did.
2	#	All right, I made up the part about the car, but the rest is true. And he hated me anyway!
2	#	I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. I feel like a gargoyle perched on the ledge of a building.
2	#	What's with all the butter?
2	#	Who?
2	#	You miss her, don't you?
2	#	You miss her.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	(sniffing) Hmm. Game hen?
2	#	No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because I sprained my ankle.
2	#	Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --
2	#	I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
2	#	So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.
2	#	That's true, that always happens to me.
2	#	I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.
2	#	Maybe I am.
2	#	Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) Puke! Don't have to think about that.
2	#	Good morning, sir.
2	#	Oh, no, that's just the old, uh, the old handicap acting up.
2	#	Oh well, that's, uh, thats just because we're, uh, standing on opposite sides.
2	#	Yeah, see, uh, when we met, I was over there and, uh, you were over here, so the image, uh, the image was reversed, like, uh, like in the mirror.
2	#	See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?
2	#	(passes cane from right to left and back a few times) But, see here. Right. Wrong. Right. Wrong. Right. Right. Wrong--
2	#	Well, you're not gonna believe what happened.
2	#	Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal Rascal, Jerry. On the house.
2	#	How's the trip?
2	#	Well. Gotta motor.
2	#	Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?
2	#	What are you talking about? (Jerry grins) You're not!
2	#	You're throwing the set?
2	#	Listen Jerry. With all due respect, Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. My generation.
2	#	Nevertheless. His time has come.
2	#	Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.
2	#	Whatcha got there, the 4-volt? Heh, I did you a favor.
2	#	Oh yeah?
2	#	Are you a religious man, sir?
2	#	Ive had my difficulties.
2	#	Mr. Thomassoulo during times of great stress, people are capable of super human strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?
2	#	How about the old Spider Man live action show?
2	#	I dont understand.
2	#	Clearer
2	#	Why not? Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped toilets in the city.
2	#	Theyre the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.
2	#	Hello-o-o-o Elaine!
2	#	(doing the voice) Not at all.
2	#	Thats beautiful.
2	#	Witness.
2	#	Percentage?
2	#	Good Morning!
2	#	Hi Allison, thats a nice dress.
2	#	Hey Glenn!
2	#	Heard that one already.
2	#	(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play Now office).
2	#	Siege mentality, Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers last days here.
2	#	Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.
2	#	Im a weed in Hitlers bunker.
2	#	Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.
2	#	I dont know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.
2	#	Bring it on!
2	#	(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!
2	#	(doing the voice) La la la.
2	#	(Interrupts) And I still say hes naked under there!
2	#	Oh, shut up!
2	#	(whistling).(laughing).AlrightOK.
2	#	(on phone  calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.
2	#	You broke up with her? Why?
2	#	I think Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? La-la-la?
2	#	I think I like the girl better than the voice.
2	#	I told you.
2	#	(talking from bathroom) Witness?
2	#	I think Play Now is putting something in my food.
2	#	I told you.
2	#	You see if I stay the whole year, I get it all.
2	#	Well played.
2	#	You have to drink that whole thing?
2	#	Would a giant rubber ball work?
2	#	Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?
2	#	Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.
2	#	(again from bathroom) Witness.
2	#	Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.
2	#	Hey, use mine. Ill let you in.
2	#	I uh, took care of that.
2	#	I insist. Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) I got it.
2	#	So, check out my view.
2	#	Hey, theres Kramer & Darren.
2	#	Hello.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	No.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	(doing the voice) Im slippery as an eel
2	#	All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit sideways.
2	#	What is that?
2	#	Are you supposed to yell it?
2	#	What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?
2	#	Why does she want you to be mad?
2	#	So what do you care what she thinks.
2	#	She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.
2	#	Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters)
2	#	I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?
2	#	Really? You wanna come?
2	#	Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind keeps blowing the door off.
2	#	Dad, what's all this?
2	#	You're selling computers?
2	#	Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and IBM?
2	#	Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.
2	#	All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's garage, help him sell some computers.
2	#	Kramer.
2	#	What-what are you doing?
2	#	Morning, ma.
2	#	Morning, dad.
2	#	What is Lloyd Braun doing here?
2	#	Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?
2	#	(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?
2	#	You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!
2	#	You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell computers! Hello, Mr. Farneman. You wanna buy a computer? No? Why not? All right, I see! Good answer! Thank you! (Lloyd rings his sale bell) Serenity now!
2	#	Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's apartment)
2	#	(hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down in the dumps? Come on. It's just a chick.
2	#	Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.
2	#	What?
2	#	I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what? If you want a computer, call me. I-I gotta go.
2	#	I don't want to hear it, Kramer!
2	#	What signal? What-what signal?
2	#	If I do it, will you buy a computer?
2	#	Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.
2	#	Will you shut up?!
2	#	Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.
2	#	It means a non-Jewish woman.
2	#	You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.
2	#	I'll tell you what's insane the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.
2	#	There's porn.
2	#	Damn it!
2	#	(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment. Then, after I win the contest, I bring 'em all back and get my money back. Ha ha! It's brilliant. What? What's wrong with your leg?
2	#	(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.
2	#	(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?
2	#	What do you know? You were in the nut house.
2	#	I heard they found a family in your freezer
2	#	Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!
2	#	Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?
2	#	Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?
2	#	Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.
2	#	All right... here goes...
2	#	So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything I'm capable of. That's me.
2	#	Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a little compassion.
2	#	I love you, Jerry.
2	#	You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the two of you get back together.
2	#	Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?
2	#	Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.
2	#	Hoochie mama'?
2	#	What are you doing?
2	#	Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.
2	#	Um, cream soda?
2	#	I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!
2	#	I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.
2	#	I don't know, I was starving Jerry!
2	#	Oh, pudding! You want some?
2	#	What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.
2	#	So eh, what do you say?
2	#	Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...
2	#	Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?
2	#	Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!
2	#	No.
2	#	She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.
2	#	Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.
2	#	Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.
2	#	Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)
2	#	Pudding skin singles.
2	#	Oh, Tara!
2	#	Three pints of Kramer's blood?
2	#	Well, so much for purification week.
2	#	Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.
2	#	She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.
2	#	Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!
2	#	And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.)
2	#	Pleasuring you?
2	#	I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.
2	#	I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.
2	#	I think you're right. You gonna eat that?
2	#	These fries are really really good...
2	#	Uuh, sleepy.
2	#	Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.
2	#	Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.
2	#	Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.
2	#	All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.
2	#	That's because it's underwater.
2	#	Is it?
2	#	Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.
2	#	Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?
2	#	Very.
2	#	Vivian!!
2	#	Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.
2	#	Ouch!
2	#	I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.
2	#	(knocking on the counter and feigning a muffled, Chinese voice) Chinese food!
2	#	Who was it?
2	#	What about your old car? They couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
2	#	Fragile Frankie Merman? I never liked that guy.
2	#	Every summer you guys went to camp together. I was jealous. Felt like he was the summer me.
2	#	I made him up.
2	#	No.
2	#	(holding a magazine cover) Mira Sorvino. Think she'd go out with me?
2	#	I can't. I gotta make the weekly call to the folks.
2	#	I gotta prep. I need a couple of anecdotes, a few you-were-right-abouts. It's a whole procedure. Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one that used to run into the woods every time he got upset?
2	#	Is he still nuts?
2	#	Hey, it's Georgie.
2	#	Ma!
2	#	Dad, it's me. Hey, listen, I was at Fortunoff's the other day, and, you know what, you were right.
2	#	Chinese food?
2	#	After dark? Please. At their age, that's like swallowing stun grenades.
2	#	That's dynamite. Yeah, I'll look for the Chinese food leftovers.
2	#	Nothing. Uh, I don't know. I gotta go.
2	#	Just dropped in for a visit. You, uh, you never called me back.
2	#	What? Where are you going?
2	#	You're going like that?
2	#	(checking the fridge) No Chinese leftovers. George is gettin' suspicious.
2	#	(surprising his parents in the kitchen) Welcome back.
2	#	Quick for a... catered affair.
2	#	You ditched me. That's twice. Now I demand to know what's going on!
2	#	I'm not following.
2	#	You're cuttin' me loose?
2	#	They don't want to see me anymore!
2	#	It is. I'm just not ready yet.
2	#	Ah, shut up, Jerry. My parents think they can ignore me. Heh heh. Well, they better think again.
2	#	You remember my cousin Rhisa? I'm gonna date her.
2	#	One little wink. She'll freak out, tell my parents. They'll be all over me. Who is this guy?
2	#	Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?
2	#	That's pretty pathetic.
2	#	Uh... hey. I'm gonna get going.
2	#	(at dinner with his cousin) Some more merlot?
2	#	Sure. You know, Rhisa. I've always found you... very attractive.
2	#	I know it may sound shocking. But, I just can't stop myself from... wanting you.
2	#	No, no. I-I just want us to be... together.
2	#	All right?
2	#	Well... we could dance around it a little first.
2	#	Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
2	#	She's leaving me dirty messages on my answering machine.
2	#	She wants to keep it quiet. She... thinks we have a real future together.
2	#	Why is the mailman wearing a bucket?
2	#	Then... shouldn't you be wearing the bucket.
2	#	Wait a minute? He's picking up the van tonight? This is perfect. I'll drive Rhisa to someplace romantic. Then when my father slides the door open, I'm in the van kissing his brother's daughter.
2	#	Yeah, hold on. I'm, uh, I'm just trying to get a reading on my dashboard compass. Where are my parents?
2	#	I think he's saying 'Son of Sam'! Oh, my God!
2	#	(running out and away from the van) I knew it wasn't Berkowitz!
2	#	Jerry! Hey, that's the guy!
2	#	Oh. The summer me.
2	#	(seeing Jerry's van shaking) What is that? That van's a-rockin'.
2	#	(seeing his parents being intimate) Oh, my god!
2	#	Ohhhh...
2	#	Oh, God...
2	#	Oh... make it stop.
2	#	You know I uh, spilled a yogurt smoothie in here two days ago. Hm, Can't smell anything, can ya?
2	#	Right.
2	#	Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
2	#	So uh where we eating?
2	#	What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but i-i-it's not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?
2	#	Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept the blame for this!
2	#	I'm getting nothing.
2	#	Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
2	#	I don't understand women.
2	#	Hey (sees the coffee stain) Art Garfunkel?
2	#	Right.
2	#	Ahh, Ah-AhWe had a deal!
2	#	Jerry?
2	#	Well, it happened again.
2	#	Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.
2	#	I-I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It-it's like the pigeons decided to ignore me!
2	#	Boy that-that bank clock is-is eight minutes off.
2	#	Zing.
2	#	Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to swerve to get out of the way! I saved that pigeons life!
2	#	Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!
2	#	Well, uh, are there any other options?
2	#	What might that cost?
2	#	Well? (Miranda hits George) I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.
2	#	Yeah. yeah. I-I know.
2	#	So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
2	#	Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!
2	#	More wine and turkey? (Pours Celia more wine)
2	#	Oh.
2	#	Four hours.
2	#	(playing with toys) Ahhhh, Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry. (hands Jerry the Mattel Football. George starts playing with the Etch-a-sketch.)
2	#	Is he dead?
2	#	So ... uh, squirrel.
2	#	What's that?
2	#	He has no home. He's a squirrel.
2	#	It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's gonna gnaw my brain out in my sleep!
2	#	That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. C-Can I bring the squirrel by?
2	#	I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel off my hands. It's practically bionic!
2	#	Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.
2	#	Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind the EZ Bake oven.
2	#	Oh, me, me, me, me, me!
2	#	Oh, don't look. T-This is the part where they change me.
2	#	I was seven and a half.
2	#	Mister Fowler, I-I have a squirrel here that is a miracle of modern science! (laughs)
2	#	Uh.
2	#	Ahhhh, Ahh, Ah, Ahhh, Ahh, Ah!
2	#	Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work ... sorry bout the set.
2	#	Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.
2	#	Still getting nothing!
2	#	So go ahead pigeons. hu hu hu. Laugh it up. I'm getting in my car now and the last I heard ... we have NO DEAL!
2	#	Does that mean I have to go too?
2	#	Hey, shut up.
2	#	And on your dates.
2	#	Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.
2	#	That should be 14, let me just...(corrects it with a pen.)
2	#	You won't regret this, sir.
2	#	...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; the boom box incident.
2	#	Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and I chuck it in to the ocean.
2	#	Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them out, not the kids.
2	#	So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the hell out of there.
2	#	Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. I could go hog wild in there.
2	#	Like retouched.
2	#	Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.
2	#	What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.
2	#	Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!
2	#	I am aware!
2	#	I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.
2	#	When are you going on your next date with her?
2	#	What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?
2	#	This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!
2	#	Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!
2	#	No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...
2	#	Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)
2	#	Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.
2	#	What is this? This is a drawing.
2	#	This is a cartoon!
2	#	But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!
2	#	I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.
2	#	Without his shirt on.
2	#	It seemed so disorganized.
2	#	What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.
2	#	I think.
2	#	Maybe I could be a land guy.
2	#	Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!
2	#	I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?
2	#	Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?
2	#	Yeah you did, you classed it up!
2	#	Oh, so it backfired?
2	#	So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.
2	#	Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?
2	#	Could she do that at Kruger?
2	#	So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.
2	#	Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.
2	#	And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..
2	#	Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.
2	#	I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.
2	#	His personal file, I, I don't ask...
2	#	Jerry, what are you doing...
2	#	Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!
2	#	Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.
2	#	Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.
2	#	And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.
2	#	Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...
2	#	Kramer, I really owe you one.
2	#	What?
2	#	So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.
2	#	Because, you're not a dermatologist.
2	#	Whoa, whoa, a section?!
2	#	No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...
2	#	No! Absolutely Not!
2	#	Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.
2	#	Why don't you see someone about it?
2	#	You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.
2	#	You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.
2	#	I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.
2	#	Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.
2	#	Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.
2	#	Whatever.
2	#	Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!
2	#	That's what they tell me!
2	#	He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?
2	#	What did he give you for it.
2	#	Have to give him time on this hour.
2	#	So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!
2	#	(Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
2	#	Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!
2	#	You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!
2	#	I don't want to talk about it.
2	#	(While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to the bathroom the entire time we were in India.
2	#	(While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed me!
2	#	Oh you can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!
2	#	(To his girlfriend) Nina, you have to decide right now. Jerry or me?
2	#	What?! Well, what are you doing here?
2	#	Five' eight! Five' seven!
2	#	(Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got to go to the bathroom.
2	#	(Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.
2	#	(Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
2	#	Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously angered at Jerry) I believe you know Nina.
2	#	(Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot more than talk! You betrayed me!
2	#	(Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything! I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!
2	#	You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!
2	#	It's an expression.
2	#	(Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with Elaine. That's the only way to punish you!
2	#	(Losing it) Funny guy!
2	#	Elaine, you have to sleep with me.
2	#	Reparations!
2	#	(Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with the groom?!
2	#	No (snorts - Laughing nervously)... I'm gonna wear black shoes.
2	#	(Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good. Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny man. (Leaves)
2	#	Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?
2	#	(Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people. (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
2	#	Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl, Nina. And what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend -- with whom there are no secrets. (Flashes two intertwined fingers) Like this. Since the fourth grade.
2	#	(Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to Jerry) Right here!
2	#	Ho, ha, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!
2	#	So, Jerry and Nina, huh?
2	#	You already told me everything.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	For how long?
2	#	Great. Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the BEST TIME with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with her already. You are a great friend. (Hugs Jerry) A great, great friend.
2	#	Great! (snaps fingers and grabs the extra plane ticket) Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and Elaine. Me and Nina.
2	#	(Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned Nina?
2	#	Why do you keep saying Nina?
2	#	Uhh.. I'll- I'll meet you down there.
2	#	FDR?
2	#	(Guessing the look) Stink eye?
2	#	Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house, you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"
2	#	Timberlands. (Showing Elaine his boots)
2	#	Jerry, would you make the call already?
2	#	(To Elaine) Told me the same thing.
2	#	You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his head 'no') Perfect.
2	#	(Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..
2	#	I'll have the Clams Casino.
2	#	(Showing Jerry the menu) "Chef recommends"
2	#	(Motioning toward waitress) I think she likes me.
2	#	So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina? (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?
2	#	Well, what's the reason?
2	#	How engrossing?
2	#	Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement lined up for me, do ya? heh he he he he he...
2	#	I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wear them every time I see her.
2	#	In any other shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!
2	#	In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes his Clams Casino) Hm.. tastes a little funky.
2	#	Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel good to be alive.
2	#	Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!
2	#	Five' eight. Five' seven.
2	#	Nice to meet you.
2	#	How as the date?
2	#	Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.
2	#	(clearing his throat, he changes his order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.
2	#	Sorry.
2	#	Hey!
2	#	She ate breakfast naked?
2	#	I've had bedroom naked, I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked... I have never had living-room naked.
2	#	It's like you're livin' in the Playboy Mansion! Did she, uh, did she frolic?
2	#	(seeing Elaine and Puddy come into Monk's) Yeah. Hey, Lainie, Puddy.
2	#	Stanky Hanke'? What did he want?
2	#	Ho ho ho ho! I can't wait for Hanke to come crawling back to me.
2	#	Still upset. Very upset.
2	#	Remember that New Year's party he threw a few years ago? He had that very drafty apartment, you know, I think on Ninth Avenue.
2	#	I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
2	#	I said preferably cashmere, for warmth. So in front of the whole party, he says, 'No. I don't want you stretching out the neck hole.'
2	#	Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up. Everybody else did!
2	#	Regardless. I had to walk around for the rest of the party in some cheap Metlife windbreaker. Now, it is payback time.
2	#	It's my head!
2	#	So she coughed.
2	#	Everything goes with naked.
2	#	Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man. Do you now how much mental energy I expend just trying to picture women naked?
2	#	All right. It's grovel time.
2	#	What are you up to now, uh, Step Nine?
2	#	Important step. Maybe the most important.
2	#	(entering Jerry's bathroom) Well, Hanke's moved on to Step Ten. He was spotted taking personal inventory.
2	#	All he has to do now is count his blessings, say a prayer, and he's done. Do you believe this?
2	#	(entering Monk's) Oh, hello, Hanke, others.
2	#	You know, Jason, I, uh, I couldn't help notice, I... I didn't get my apology.
2	#	A drafty apartment? A... sweaterless friend? A ball-game giveaway Metlife windbreaker?
2	#	Yeah, the neck hole thing, and I would appreciate it if you would say you're sorry.
2	#	You're an alcoholic! You have to apologize. Step Nine! Step Nine.
2	#	Jerry, I felt like a straight man in some horrible sketch. He was riffing! Riffing! On my pain!
2	#	That's right. I'm two in the hole!
2	#	Did you explain to her about the good naked and the bad naked?
2	#	Well... what if you showed up bad naked, huh? You still got that belt sander?
2	#	(going into the bathroom) Well, you on all fours, that thing vibratin', kickin' up sawdust, ho ho! She'll get the picture!
2	#	So you're Jason Hanke's supervisor?
2	#	Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned about this guy.
2	#	Yeah, well when you don't actually do the steps, you can go through them pretty quick. You can get through six a day.
2	#	I don't know. A little thing called Step Nine? Instead of an apology, he was beboppin' and scattin' all over me.
2	#	Well, aren't you the boss of him? You shouldn't let him move up! When I was in the Cub Scouts, I got stuck on Weebolos for three years 'cause I kept losing the Pinewood Derby.
2	#	Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.
2	#	Yeah, let him chew on that for a while.
2	#	All right. That's more like it. Thank you very much. (giving the sponsor the 'be strong' hand clench) By the way, my uncle was an alcoholic, so...
2	#	(sitting down) Where's Hanke?
2	#	What? Rate-aholics?
2	#	Hey, I am not here for rage. I'm here for revenge.
2	#	Excuse me. Am I talking to you, Pinhead? Am I?!
2	#	I'm losin' it!
2	#	Probably because this whole Universe is against me!
2	#	I know. And now they want me to bottle it up. It makes me so mad!
2	#	This bread has nuts in it!
2	#	Why not? It's a good look for a woman.
2	#	Well, some women like it.
2	#	Well, I'm here. What is it?
2	#	(ready to leave) Well, thank you.
2	#	Uh, excuse me, uh, um, Jason. I don't want to get into a big thing here, but... I'm not sure if, technically, what you just said was actually an apology.
2	#	Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But... I feel I gotta get the apology.
2	#	I would like an apology.
2	#	Baah! There it is! You just said it! That's what I want! Now say it again, and tell it to me.
2	#	Excuse me. Is this, uh, Rage-aholics?
2	#	Thanks. What are you guys doin' here?
2	#	Right.
2	#	Step-skipper. That man is a step-skipper! He skips Step Nine!
2	#	That's right! He never apologized to me for saying that I would stretch out the neck hole of his sweater.
2	#	It wasn't funny.
2	#	He's beboppin' and scattin', and I'm losin' it!
2	#	Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. (Laghs)
2	#	I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks.. (leaves)
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today.
2	#	Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing "We don't care, and it shows."
2	#	Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. (Starts flipping through envelopes, reads one ) "Have you seen me?" (Flicks it aside) Nope. (looks at next envelope) Woah, something from Whatley.
2	#	(Reading the card from Whatley) "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."?
2	#	I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"
2	#	Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye!
2	#	Nothing. It's a card from my dad.
2	#	It's nothing, stop it..
2	#	(Interrupting) Jerry, No!
2	#	No!
2	#	(pleading) Alright..
2	#	Jerry! Stop it!
2	#	I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine and Jerry laugh hysterically)
2	#	So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?
2	#	Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.
2	#	(Annoyed) If that helps you..
2	#	(Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood!
2	#	Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas card to Jerry)
2	#	(With pride) Made it up.
2	#	What do you think?
2	#	(Once again, Identifying) The Outlaw of Josey Whales!
2	#	Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. (Gets up to leave)
2	#	(Interrupting) No!
2	#	Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist!
2	#	Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! (Co-worker gives a gift to George) Oh, Sandy! Here is a little something for you.. (hands her a card)
2	#	Phil, I loved those cigars! Incoming! (Flicks his card tward Phil)
2	#	Aw, Mr. Kruger, Sir. Merry Christmas! (Hands him a card)
2	#	The Human Fund.
2	#	Exactly. (Sees an off-camera co-worker) Erica!
2	#	So, she was switching? Back and forth?
2	#	So, just bring her here. This is all you really need.
2	#	Lights out.
2	#	(Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine!
2	#	I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener.
2	#	What is that? Is taht the pole?!
2	#	(Sulking) That's why I hate it.
2	#	(Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
2	#	No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!
2	#	20 thousand dollars?
2	#	Hey! Surprise, surprise!
2	#	(Sees Gwen's meal) Hey, soup.
2	#	Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)
2	#	I don't know.
2	#	I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back.
2	#	I'm serious.
2	#	I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! (Thinking to himself) .. First thing I'm gonna need is a driver..
2	#	Well, there could be.
2	#	Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out)
2	#	Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.
2	#	Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!
2	#	Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove it - if I had to.
2	#	Happy Festivus!
2	#	Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.
2	#	Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.
2	#	Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama!
2	#	Embracing my roots.
2	#	Busted cold.
2	#	Oh, God.
2	#	Not the feats of strength..
2	#	Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?
2	#	Oh, please, somebody, stop this!
2	#	Oh, come on! Be sensible.
2	#	Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!
2	#	When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?
2	#	Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.
2	#	No. That's just electric.
2	#	(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?
2	#	The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.
2	#	And the underwater bubble cities?
2	#	Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.
2	#	I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..
2	#	Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.
2	#	There's an easy move go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.
2	#	Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.
2	#	My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, "Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!"
2	#	Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "Ill walk out of here right now!"
2	#	(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!
2	#	(Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im doin here.
2	#	(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.
2	#	Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?
2	#	(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.
2	#	Dont think it cant happen! (Leaves)
2	#	Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything, did ya?
2	#	(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!
2	#	(To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar.
2	#	(Talking it) Im here helpin you.
2	#	(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think.
2	#	Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5.
2	#	Ah, come on!
2	#	Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?
2	#	Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?
2	#	(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.
2	#	(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry.
2	#	(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..
2	#	People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.
2	#	The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.
2	#	(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.
2	#	Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in!
2	#	(Stingy) Its wrinkled. Its worthless.
2	#	(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!
2	#	They did?
2	#	As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled "Employees Only". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it!
2	#	Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one, and gotten both.
2	#	No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!
2	#	Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.
2	#	Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.
2	#	Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.
2	#	(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..
2	#	Hey, starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry)
2	#	I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!
2	#	Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)
2	#	All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!
2	#	Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.
2	#	(Standing up) Yes. This is wrong!
2	#	Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch
2	#	(Losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!
2	#	Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.
2	#	(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?
2	#	One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!
2	#	He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.
2	#	Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.
2	#	Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.
2	#	No. Rice and caramel.
2	#	No.
2	#	Please.
2	#	All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and for him to be fired!
2	#	They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!
2	#	All right, do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, what are you gonna do about my Twix?
2	#	No! Theres no coconut!
2	#	Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?
2	#	Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.
2	#	Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)
2	#	Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?! Theyre - theyre all on the floor!
2	#	And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?! Like, 8 Twix?!
2	#	Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup! A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!
2	#	(Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle) Twwwwiiiiiixxxxx!
2	#	(Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good.
2	#	I dont know. All of em. Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different candy bars, anyway.
2	#	What was that?
2	#	And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
2	#	An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.
2	#	All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have a sixth sense.
2	#	Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.
2	#	I'll have 'em overnight it.
2	#	It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
2	#	Because important things go in a case. You got a skull for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for your money.
2	#	I need everything in there.
2	#	I might go there.
2	#	All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet & Lows.
2	#	A man carries a wallet.
2	#	Love to.
2	#	No, I don't have it yet.
2	#	No, I brought a picture of the chair.
2	#	I thought we'd all sign the picture.
2	#	(answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
2	#	And you threw it out the window?
2	#	God, you're like a rock star.
2	#	Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.
2	#	This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.
2	#	Here, just give me a couple of napkins.
2	#	There, there I'm fine.
2	#	I think I had some hard candy in there.
2	#	No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.
2	#	Ahhh. How does this thing work?
2	#	Ahhhhh...
2	#	Ahhhhh...
2	#	Yeah?
2	#	Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...
2	#	It's in... transit.
2	#	(hearing Elaine over the phone) What, she's out?
2	#	Allllll right!
2	#	(hangs up the phone) That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
2	#	Hey.
2	#	It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
2	#	Excuse me?
2	#	Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer and I have to pay for the entire gift?
2	#	He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? It was your suggestion.
2	#	Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?
2	#	I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, and now you're all screwin' me!
2	#	I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
2	#	Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.
2	#	Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.
2	#	Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.
2	#	My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!
2	#	Hey!
2	#	That's cute.
2	#	No, never mind.
2	#	Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner .
2	#	Well, I can't crack this one.
2	#	try shaking it...(long pause) Well,Janet should be here any minute.
2	#	Aah! the minute I saw this girl, we just clicked. She's got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her mouth, nose
2	#	Jerry, Elaine, I give you.. Janet.
2	#	Oh! euh.. Yeah We just can't go to the supermarket to get some candy.
2	#	Hey! George and Janet.
2	#	Kramer, what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look anything like Jerry
2	#	No..hummm, What do you know about what you look like.
2	#	(nervous) All right now we're going bye bye.
2	#	Well,,, it's getting dark.
2	#	What does that mean?
2	#	(to Jerry) What do you mean by that?
2	#	Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..
2	#	Why would I...
2	#	Yes.
2	#	No...
2	#	Exactly.
2	#	...neither am I.
2	#	Where's the crazy man, Come on up.
2	#	Haaaaaa!!!
2	#	Don't leave (George slams the door)
2	#	What's the decision?
2	#	Silence YES!!
2	#	(frantic by now) SHUT UP,SHUT UP, SHUT UP,...(then leaves)
2	#	(we hear him think) My friends are idiots, she doesn't look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody. And so what if does look like Jerry,what does that mean?. That I could have everything I have with Jerry but because it's a woman I could also have sex with her....And that somehow that would be exactly what I always wanted.....She doesn't even look like Jerry..
2	#	I know....
2	#	You know, you know what's great about our relationship?...It's not about looks.
2	#	No, Can't be...For instance I remember when we first met, we had a great conversation.
2	#	....But after that we really talked didn't we?
2	#	Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about something and fast or I'm in very serious and weird trouble....hum What else happened?
2	#	Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
2	#	I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.
2	#	I'm losin' it
2	#	OK Look, the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be about something else...anything..please.
2	#	Your hair?
2	#	George is in big trouble....
2	#	like that (looking at Jerry)
2	#	..That.
2	#	Yes..
2	#	Nooo...
2	#	Exactly..
2	#	We...must never ever speak of this again..
2	#	Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off (starts to leave)
2	#	(clears throat) Maura, I, uh- I want you to know... I-I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sorry, but... we, uh, we have to break up.
2	#	(double takes) What's that?
2	#	(puzzled) W-we're not?
2	#	All right (he smiles weakly at Maura)
2	#	She said no.
2	#	What could I do?! We fooled around and went to a movie!
2	#	Well, I don't really like her.
2	#	I don't find her attractive.
2	#	I'd like to sleep with a LOT of other women.
2	#	Sometimes at restaurants she talks to her food 'Ooh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes, you are sooo goood.'
2	#	And in bed--
2	#	What?
2	#	I got some cufflinks I could've loaned you.
2	#	You already have an in. You have the same first name!... (no reaction) 'Jerry'!
2	#	Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.
2	#	Well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about The A-Team!
2	#	And so, for all these reasons, we are officially broken up. (shuts book and reaches for door) Thank you, (opens door) and good night.
2	#	(gestures towards book) But I proved it!
2	#	Well, then, I am gonna have to ask you to turn your key.
2	#	(shouting) Turn your key, Maura. Turn your key!
2	#	(from the street below Jerry's window) Jerry!
2	#	(puzzled) I bought it. (enters lobby)
2	#	Sounds like a scam. (takes a bite from the granola bar)
2	#	So, I broke up with Maura. It's done. I'm out.
2	#	Feels right. (cheerfully takes another bite)
2	#	(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.
2	#	Want a bite?
2	#	(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)
2	#	(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!
2	#	Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?
2	#	(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom)
2	#	(entering Monk's) Hey.
2	#	(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
2	#	Who's this, Blue Arrow?
2	#	Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
2	#	Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.
2	#	She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.
2	#	Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.
2	#	She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.
2	#	So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?
2	#	Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles)
2	#	(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch)
2	#	(walking back) Are you sure? 'Cause it could really help me out of a jam.
2	#	Oh, not more building.
2	#	No?
2	#	(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)
2	#	This isn't going well.
2	#	You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)
2	#	(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of "Godspell" with the other.
2	#	(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)
2	#	The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.
2	#	I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.
2	#	Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!
2	#	(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)
2	#	(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives... (grabbing coat) Well, I understand if you never want to see me again, so... (points towards door)
2	#	(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?
2	#	You?
2	#	All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them)
2	#	All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?
2	#	So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)
2	#	When are they gonna learn that any news about China is an instant page-turner? (seeing Jerry with a small black device) What's that?
2	#	How much was it?
2	#	Where are you gettin' a Wizard for fifty dollars?
2	#	I got a message from the Rosses at work today.
2	#	At the funeral, give or take. You know, deep down, I always kinda felt that they blamed me for Susan's death.
2	#	No, he isn't.
2	#	I thought he looked Irish.
2	#	That's not Irish.
2	#	Should we be talkin' about this?
2	#	No, it isn't.
2	#	Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.
2	#	(pulling out some money) Uh, yeah. Hang on. Just... yeah.
2	#	(on the phone) Uh, Mrs. Ross? It's-it's George.
2	#	George Costanza. Susan's, uh, friend? Long time no speak.
2	#	Oh, I just, uh, leased a house out in the Hamptons, and I have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
2	#	Oh, sure. I mean, after all, you were almost my, uh... OK, I gotta go.
2	#	Well, you know, I've been lyin' about my income for a few years. I figured I could afford a fake house in the Hamptons.
2	#	How are they gonna make that book into a movie?
2	#	Yeah?
2	#	Oh.
2	#	(to a street vender selling hot dogs) You must hate hot dogs, huh? Or else, you, uh, you really like 'em and that's why you, you do this.
2	#	I'll tell ya, if I had one of these things, I'd be eatin' hot dogs all the time.
2	#	Mmm... no.
2	#	Actually, I did have a thought.
2	#	Why don't you just ask him?
2	#	Maybe he's, um... mixed.
2	#	I really don't think we're supposed to be talkin' about this.
2	#	(standing up) I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Rosses.
2	#	Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.
2	#	Yeah, I may move out there. (getting 'yeah, right' glances from the Rosses) I mean it, I'll do it! OK, I'll see ya later. Keep it real!
2	#	(entering Jerry's apartment) Jerry?
2	#	(to Elaine) What are you doin' here?
2	#	(to Elaine) He asked you to get the mail?
2	#	(taking the phone from Elaine) Jerry, why is Elaine getting your mail?
2	#	What about the mail?
2	#	(hanging up) All right, Jerry. I'll do it. See ya.
2	#	So, I ran into the Rosses again.
2	#	From me.
2	#	I told them I have a place in the Hamptons. What did you say?
2	#	So, they knew? Those liars!
2	#	Yeah, but they let me go on and on all about the Hamptons, they never said a thing! You don't let somebody lie when they know you're lying. You call them a liar!
2	#	Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?
2	#	Hmm-hmm, not by a long shot. I'm calling up the Rosses and inviting them up to my non-existent place in the Hamptons. Then we'll see who blinks first.
2	#	This is not about them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to exercise Jerry's gaskets.
2	#	So... here I am. Ready to take you to the Hamptons.
2	#	Do you have your bathing suits?
2	#	Speak now, or we are headed to the Hamptons. It's a two-hour drive. Once you get in that car, we are going all the way... to the Hamptons. All right, you wanna get nuts? Come on. Let's get nuts!
2	#	You want to hear more? The master bedroom opens into the solarium.
2	#	Yes, two solariums. Quite a find. And I have horses, too?
2	#	Snoopy and Prickly Pete. Should I keep driving?
2	#	(chuckling to himself) Housewarming gift. (swerving the car to go to the antique stand) All right, we're taking it up a notch!
2	#	Almost there.
2	#	We, uh, we go on foot from here.
2	#	There's no house! It's a lie! There's no solarium. There's no Prickly Pete. There's no other solarium.
2	#	Then, why? Why did you make me drive all the way out here? Why didn't you say something? Why? Why? Why?
2	#	Oh.
2	#	Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.
2	#	Or we don't even send the check and then when they call, we pretend we're the cleaning service. Heh heh. "Hello? I sorry, no here Kruger."
2	#	I had 'em, Jerry. They loved me.
2	#	I lost them. I can usually come up with one good comment during a meeting but by the end it's buried under a pile of gaffs and bad puns.
2	#	I can't just leave.
2	#	You never played Vegas.
2	#	I like Christian rock. It's very positive. It's not like those real musicians who think they're so cool and hip.
2	#	Tell you how you could check.
2	#	Reprogram all the buttons, see if he changes them back. You know? The old switcheroo.
2	#	No, it's doing the same thing to someone that they did to you.
2	#	Well that's the gist of it!
2	#	By the way, how did Puddy get back in the picture?
2	#	Alright, well why don't we smooth the head down to nothing, stick a pumpkin under its arm and change the nameplate to Ichabod Crane?
2	#	(getting up and leaving) Alright! That's it for me. Goodnight everybody.
2	#	I knew I had hit my high note so I thanked the crowd and I was gone.
2	#	I saw "Titanic". So that old woman, she's just a liar, right?
2	#	Hey, so, did you give that radio the old switcheroo?
2	#	And the Christian rock?
2	#	Jerry, do you have any fishsticks?
2	#	I think it's neat. You don't hear that much about god anymore.
2	#	I'm against all "it's me"s. So self-absorbed and egotistical, it's like those hip musicians with their complicated shoes!
2	#	They? The Government?
2	#	I guess there are no small diseases, only small actors.
2	#	(leaving) Alright that's it for me. Good night everybody.
2	#	She's still doing that?
2	#	Alright, I'll tell you what you do. You call her back and give her the "it's me", heh? Pull the old switcheroo.
2	#	What the hell is a gander, anyway?
2	#	Good, let her think it.
2	#	Ask about you, ask about you.
2	#	Abort! Abort!
2	#	That was very real.
2	#	Woah, back it up, back it up. Beep, beep, beep. Tractor story?
2	#	You know what I think? I bet she stole a tractor.
2	#	Does she walk around holding a pen she never seems to need?
2	#	Oh. Okay, here it is, I got it. She lost her thumbs in a tractor accident and they grafted her big toes on. They do it every day.
2	#	How's her handshake? A little firm, isn't it? Maybe a little too firm?
2	#	Hands a little smelly?
2	#	(To a passing waitress) I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.
2	#	(to the waitress bringing his doughnut) And a slice of devil's food cake.
2	#	Hey. Where is everyone?
2	#	I am?
2	#	This is a huge project involving lots of numbers and papers and folders.
2	#	Okay.
2	#	And?
2	#	A scar?
2	#	A tractor.
2	#	I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.
2	#	Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--
2	#	Two-man? It's all me. Kruger doesn't do anything; Disappears for hours at a time, gives me fake excuses. This afternoon I found him with sleep creases on his face. The only reason I got out to get a bite today was that he finally promised to buckle down and do some actual work. (turning around, George sees Mr. Kruger at a booth eating a piece of cake) Oh, I don't believe this. This is what I have to put up with, Jerry. (He walks over) Mr. Kruger? Who said he was going to do some actual work today? Who?
2	#	Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?
2	#	(to Jerry) Huh-ho! Have you ever seen anything like this?
2	#	Would you mind helping me out with some of this stuff?!?
2	#	No! I don't! Don't you even care? This is your company! It's your name on the outside of the building! Speaking of which, the 'R' fell off and all it says now is K-uger!
2	#	Huh-ho! Oh! You are too much, Mr. Kruger! Too much!
2	#	Oh no, you're not going out on a high note with me Mr. Kruger!
2	#	No! No!
2	#	I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet girls in New York.
2	#	I'm gonna hit the head.
2	#	(Acting innocent) I'm all set.
2	#	(Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to hear?
2	#	They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me. (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it wasn't for the toilet, there would be no books.
2	#	They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded by reading material. It's entrapment!
2	#	I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
2	#	Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?
2	#	(Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to the man!
2	#	You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?
2	#	You went home with him?
2	#	Hey, me too.
2	#	Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.
2	#	Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.
2	#	Why not?
2	#	(Confused) Flagged?
2	#	It says that on the computer?
2	#	(Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business! Because I love to read!
2	#	Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!
2	#	I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.
2	#	Nothing.
2	#	You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.
2	#	(Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.
2	#	Simmer!
2	#	(The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry) May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?
2	#	Well, aren't you something?
2	#	Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.
2	#	Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.
2	#	Oh.
2	#	(Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's rediculous.
2	#	(Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?
2	#	I could take it in merchandise..
2	#	I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
2	#	So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That way, everything is even.
2	#	I'm goin' in!
2	#	No! Jerry!
2	#	Mario's Pizza.
2	#	Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?
2	#	We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
2	#	Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.
2	#	Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!
2	#	Ah, beat it, punk.
2	#	Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one has beaten me in like 10 years.
2	#	The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just the right amount of grease on the joy stick...
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--
2	#	Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.
2	#	So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and help me pick up the Frogger?
2	#	What?
2	#	You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!
2	#	No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?
2	#	Well, is he good, Kramer?
2	#	Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.
2	#	Slippery Pete?
2	#	All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must live on!
2	#	So you slept with her?
2	#	And you automatically sleep with her?
2	#	Finished your thought.
2	#	An ostrich burger.
2	#	You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
2	#	What's that?
2	#	Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what you do.
2	#	Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.
2	#	Oh...you're very good.
2	#	Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the loading zone.
2	#	All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened in the past is past.
2	#	Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.
2	#	What do you mean?
2	#	No. I--I paid for it.
2	#	We're not stealing it.
2	#	All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?
2	#	Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. This is the front door, and this is the outlet.
2	#	The outlet?
2	#	That's where the electricity comes out.
2	#	Uh, here.
2	#	The Frogger is here.
2	#	All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
2	#	Jerry, you came for the big moment.
2	#	Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.
2	#	Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.
2	#	Where?
2	#	I hear thee.
2	#	What are you guys doing?
2	#	You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
2	#	Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
2	#	I need an outlet!
2	#	Holes! I need holes!
2	#	All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk the pharmacist.
2	#	Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of something. I can do this.
2	#	Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.
2	#	What happened to your voice?
2	#	Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.
2	#	The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.
2	#	But I was thinking...T-bone.
2	#	There's no G-bone.
2	#	That's a myth.
2	#	T-bone steak.
2	#	Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--
2	#	Uh, no. No, we shouldn't.
2	#	Hey, it's George. Listen, I-
2	#	No. No T-bone.
2	#	Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!
2	#	Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
2	#	You're sleepin' with the maid?
2	#	I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
2	#	Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?
2	#	The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.
2	#	What? Now, you listen to me!
2	#	Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From now on, I will be known as-
2	#	What?
2	#	Koko.
2	#	Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?
2	#	Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. First I had to pay for dinner, then--
2	#	How much you pay this maid?
2	#	40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't know what that was.
2	#	I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look straight forward.
2	#	What?
2	#	Never mind.
2	#	What happened to Mrs. Krantz?
2	#	I'll try a piece.
2	#	Hey.
2	#	Oh, yeah.
2	#	It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."
2	#	Really? Coco?
2	#	You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would never allow 2 Kokos.
2	#	Say good-bye to Koko.
2	#	This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.
2	#	Yes?
2	#	Coco?
2	#	Well, it was a hell of a ride.
2	#	Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about your Gammy.
2	#	Forget Gammy.
2	#	There's no Gammy.
2	#	Oh, no.
2	#	Gammy's gettin' upset!
2	#	Man, I'm starving.
2	#	Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
2	#	Those nachos are killing me.
2	#	It's complicated.
2	#	So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
2	#	Blimp The Hindenburg Story.
2	#	I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
2	#	Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"
2	#	The place went nuts.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	What's with all these flags?
2	#	I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have calmed down the nachos.
2	#	Just inch over. You worm your way.
2	#	My hand is out.
2	#	This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
2	#	Look at me! I am man! I am you!
2	#	All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.
2	#	All right! We're here!
2	#	Yeah. I'll see you later.
2	#	The movies. Blimp is playing right there.
2	#	It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.
2	#	Isn't it?
2	#	Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.
2	#	Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?
2	#	Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of my own I wanted to try.
2	#	It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...
2	#	That's gotta hurt!
2	#	It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
2	#	Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!
2	#	All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.
2	#	It's probably chocolate.
2	#	All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!
2	#	Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
2	#	This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. What if it hits my eye?
2	#	I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.
2	#	Oh, my god.
2	#	They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?
2	#	No.
2	#	Bring it on, baby
2	#	The side?
2	#	All right!
2	#	Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.
2	#	That wasn't a laser pen.
2	#	Oh, that's funny
2	#	Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?
2	#	Art.
2	#	Pennypacker. Varnsen.
2	#	Jerry, the Mets lost.
2	#	How do you suppose they did that?
2	#	I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?"
2	#	Do ya?
2	#	Same thing!
2	#	Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
2	#	Nah - what for?
2	#	I've been to the movies.
2	#	They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!
2	#	Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.
2	#	Oh, very gracious.
2	#	Yeah.
2	#	What are you crazy?
2	#	Big hefty stinking faux pas.
2	#	On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
2	#	It's dismissive.
2	#	Why don't you think before you do something?
2	#	Too much?
2	#	Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.
2	#	What?
2	#	You're so uptight.
2	#	Who's he?
2	#	Our show, "Jerry"?
2	#	"Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
2	#	When?
2	#	Right now? "Jerry"?
2	#	He wants to talk about "Jerry"?
2	#	"Jerry"!
2	#	Can I go like this?
2	#	No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
2	#	I won't feel like a writer.
2	#	Right!
2	#	Water. Need some water! Water here!
2	#	Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.
2	#	I will not blow this.
2	#	It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.
2	#	Something, nothing, I could care less.
2	#	Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm down!
2	#	Magic time.
2	#	nothing
2	#	Hey, hey, hey!
2	#	Hello Stu.
2	#	Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?
2	#	Kimbrough.
2	#	K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
2	#	It's a talent I have.
2	#	Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.
2	#	What do we have in the fruit department?
2	#	Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.
2	#	Been there, done that.
2	#	Water coolers?
2	#	See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.
2	#	It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.
2	#	I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.
2	#	Or we could get them together. Woo!
2	#	Yeah!
2	#	I'm moving to California.
2	#	Of course he liked it.
2	#	He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
2	#	I'm writing.
2	#	Ma?!
2	#	I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
2	#	So? Where are we going?
2	#	If you're bleak, you're bleak.
2	#	It's a bit hilly - no?
2	#	What if I want to walk around a little?
2	#	What if I'm at the bottom?
2	#	Me too.
2	#	This is it?
2	#	I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.
2	#	You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
2	#	Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.
2	#	This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.
2	#	Why?
2	#	It's effeminate to sit like this?
2	#	How is this effeminate?
2	#	Kramer, what are you doing?
2	#	Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
2	#	Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.
2	#	Kramer!
2	#	Oh my God!
2	#	I told you to stop with the hopping.
2	#	Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
2	#	Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
2	#	There's something I have to tell you.
2	#	I cheated in the contest.
2	#	The contest - I cheated.
2	#	Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
2	#	Hey - What's going on?
2	#	We're straightening out!
2	#	I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.
2	#	First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.
2	#	Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.
2	#	He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
2	#	I never heard of that.
2	#	Why would we want to help somebody?
2	#	That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
2	#	All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.
2	#	Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.
2	#	Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.
2	#	Yeah, he's right.
2	#	It makes me look older.
2	#	Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?
2	#	Jerry, did you hear that?
2	#	I think that's a good sign.
2	#	He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
2	#	Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!
2	#	The Bubble Boy!
2	#	Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?
2	#	Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.
2	#	Sorry, the card says Moops.
2	#	It's Moops.
2	#	Moops!
2	#	Help! Someone!
2	#	It was Moops.
2	#	Fire! Get out of the way!
2	#	Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.
2	#	Medium turkey chili.
2	#	I didn't get any bread.
2	#	Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.
2	#	Yes, please.
2	#	What?
2	#	You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
2	#	Really?
2	#	Haven't we had this conversation before?
2	#	I think we have.
3	#	I don't like to talk during a massage.
3	#	Oh! I forgot to tell you--
3	#	Oh, okay, go ahead.
3	#	What happened?
3	#	Oh, wasn't that terrible?
3	#	She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.
3	#	Really stupid. (she takes a big sip from her bottled water.)
3	#	I can't believe you said that.
3	#	So, whatd she say?
3	#	I have a good masseuse you could go to.
3	#	So where do you get this note?
3	#	What's the name of this physical therapist?
3	#	Right.
3	#	(quietly) Ok.
3	#	Why not?
3	#	No, I don't want the man either.
3	#	He'd just be touching your back.
3	#	No, it could get sexual.
3	#	I wouldn't be comfortable.
3	#	What could happen?
3	#	It's supposed to feel good.
3	#	Then why get the massage?
3	#	How'd it go? George?
3	#	What? (he bumps her with his butt to move over)
3	#	What?
3	#	Hey, you scrunched me. I sat down here first.
3	#	Joe DiMaggio?
3	#	Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?!
3	#	Why couldn't he be a dunker?
3	#	So then what?
3	#	Why didn't you just call out his name?
3	#	A what?
3	#	Hey, George? What is this? (laughing, Elaine makes the same outstretched arm motion) What is that? No really, what is that?
3	#	Three notes?
3	#	You got me a note?
3	#	But I got my own note.
3	#	I got a note from my gynecologist.
3	#	I didn't know you were getting me a note.
3	#	But you didn't say anything. Ohhh
3	#	Wait a--
3	#	Well, I mean it's only a six month probation, it's a slap on the wrist.
3	#	Of what?
3	#	What do they do?
3	#	(gasps)
3	#	And he's dunking!
3	#	Hi,
3	#	Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.
3	#	What's so funny
3	#	Uh, it's a riot Alice.
3	#	Any other time.
3	#	And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions in the living room
3	#	What are you doing? What is all this?
3	#	O, your being auditted? What for?
3	#	When was this?
3	#	I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
3	#	Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...
3	#	What did you think, that would impress me?
3	#	Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?
3	#	Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.
3	#	So, waddya' going to do?
3	#	How is that?
3	#	Why is she doing this?
3	#	I don't blame ya'
3	#	No.
3	#	How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
3	#	There are plenty of things to say.
3	#	George, please.
3	#	You sure?
3	#	What?
3	#	Forget it. You are very careful with money.
3	#	You asked me to.
3	#	HUH, so should you.
3	#	I know.
3	#	Pocketbook or a handbag?
3	#	(from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?
3	#	hell-oo
3	#	You haven't told him?
3	#	Huh, go ahead, tell him.
3	#	He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.
3	#	Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!
3	#	Jerrryyy, How can I go on?
3	#	No thanks!
3	#	No, no no.
3	#	No! Jerry! Jerry!
3	#	What is this?
3	#	Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.
3	#	Who told you this
3	#	Oh, my god.
3	#	KRAMER!
3	#	WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON.
3	#	It's invisible.
3	#	Well,
3	#	The Truth!, You want The Truth?
3	#	The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.
3	#	I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
3	#	Yeah, I suppose I am.
3	#	You know you're chippin' in.
3	#	Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug)
3	#	(looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?
3	#	I can't take your bedroom.
3	#	I can't kick you out of your bed.
3	#	Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)
3	#	Hi. Nice to meet you.
3	#	And scuba diving.
3	#	Mmm, nice to meet you.
3	#	Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it writes upside down.
3	#	Come in.
3	#	Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
3	#	Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.
3	#	I am never gonna fall asleep.
3	#	How can they not put the air conditioning on?
3	#	This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
3	#	I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.
3	#	Oh!
3	#	My back.
3	#	That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
3	#	I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
3	#	You can go.
3	#	(whispering to Jerry) Yes!
3	#	Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.
3	#	I've lost 6 pounds.
3	#	(with pain) Hi Evelyn.
3	#	The astronauts use them.
3	#	Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
3	#	No no, I wanna go.
3	#	Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.
3	#	You're not too cold?
3	#	Having a good time!
3	#	My back hurts.
3	#	(still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
3	#	Say what? (laughing) Say what?
3	#	(still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!
3	#	(still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!
3	#	(wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!
3	#	Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
3	#	(discouraged) Five days. Here.
3	#	Excuse me?
3	#	(to Jerry) Five more days?
3	#	Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.
3	#	If only.
3	#	Hey, when you walk him, do ya...
3	#	Do you pick it up?
3	#	You pick it up?!?
3	#	Oh, boy would I love to see that.
3	#	Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.
3	#	No, milk.
3	#	What is a bender anyhow?
3	#	I can't believe he hasn't called.
3	#	We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.
3	#	Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.
3	#	If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.
3	#	Are we still going to the movies tonight?
3	#	Just me and George?
3	#	But we need you.
3	#	Because... Yeah?
3	#	Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just put some newspapers down or something?
3	#	Just me and George alone?
3	#	Do, do you?
3	#	It,s, it's up to you.
3	#	Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh, you wanna see Ponce de Leon?
3	#	Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can switch apartments for the night.
3	#	I know, it's not that.
3	#	About three years.
3	#	Hmm.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
3	#	Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
3	#	No.
3	#	I know!
3	#	It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.
3	#	The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of you.
3	#	Do you have to?
3	#	You know, the guy might have just lost your number.
3	#	Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.
3	#	What is it?
3	#	Terrific.
3	#	Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.
3	#	Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.
3	#	Kramer, we like her.
3	#	I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
3	#	Well.
3	#	Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.
3	#	Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.
3	#	We'll see it Sunday.
3	#	I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.
3	#	Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Who's stopping you?
3	#	Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
3	#	Good. Good. You?
3	#	Boy, he takes such a long time.
3	#	You know what he does in there? He gargles.
3	#	Yeah, he does it like six times a day.
3	#	Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this, watch.
3	#	We talked about that already.
3	#	Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!
3	#	Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
3	#	We made plans.
3	#	I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
3	#	Jerry, you promised me we'd go.
3	#	Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.
3	#	Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.
3	#	I thought she was the one.
3	#	Okay, c'mon it's movie time.
3	#	Where's Karen?
3	#	Well, she didn't ask me what I wanted.
3	#	How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?
3	#	Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."
3	#	Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.
3	#	Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of Columbus, I gave you?
3	#	Ooh yeah, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
3	#	I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend. And then that lunch thing.
3	#	What do you know. You've never worked in an office. (TURNS TO GEORGE) See, George, you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!
3	#	What did he do?
3	#	Come on tell me what happened.
3	#	Why do they call it a wedgie?
3	#	Boys are sick.
3	#	We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder. guy who ruined his life.
3	#	Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good
3	#	Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.
3	#	What?
3	#	George is on his way up.
3	#	Are you OK? What? What?
3	#	Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT
3	#	Remember that Columbus book?
3	#	Him? Him who?
3	#	Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?
3	#	At least it wasn't atomic.
3	#	Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems. The ones that affected Kramer so much.
3	#	No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!
3	#	Hey, I didn't get one either.
3	#	This is what people do.
3	#	So we took a little ride. What's the big deal?
3	#	What do you do?
3	#	Who?
3	#	Isn't it going the other way?
3	#	But it's Saturday.
3	#	What's the matter?
3	#	Oh she's fat?
3	#	What? JERRY Where's the car?
3	#	I didn't pay attention.
3	#	I'm sure it's right around here.
3	#	It's black, right?
3	#	How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags?
3	#	(SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH) You'd better find this car.
3	#	(RE CAR) There it is!...No that's not it.
3	#	(CONT'D) Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery.
3	#	Those school zones are a killer.
3	#	(LOOKING AT FISH) I think they're laboring.
3	#	Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty.
3	#	It felt like a couple of levels.
3	#	Look at that woman.
3	#	He's got it.
3	#	Jerry, look at my fish.
3	#	My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car.
3	#	Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look.
3	#	Five minutes.
3	#	We're not wilding.
3	#	(CONT'D) Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me...
3	#	(CONT'D) Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too?
3	#	Excuse me...
3	#	(CONT'D) Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science.
3	#	Jerry!
3	#	Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him.
3	#	No, no, I'll be back.
3	#	And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him.
3	#	But why? Why can't you do it?
3	#	No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to.
3	#	But why? Why don't you want to?
3	#	But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out?
3	#	Jerry! (THEN SHE CHECKS HER FISH)
3	#	(O.C.) Jerry! JERRY Elaine?!
3	#	(O.C.) Jerry! Over here...
3	#	(CONT'D) Where have you been?
3	#	You what?
3	#	Look at my fish... (JERRY EXAMINES IT) Is he...
3	#	(DESPERATE) Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying.
3	#	I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish?
3	#	That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed.
3	#	(CONT'D) That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that?
3	#	I thought he was with you.
3	#	Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side?
3	#	We didn't come in over there!
3	#	Hi, I'm Elaine.
3	#	It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me.
3	#	(SHOUTING TO AMY) What about my fish?
3	#	I'll say.
3	#	What is it? (THEY DISCOVER WHAT HE'S STARING AT) The car!
3	#	We found it. I can't believe it!
3	#	Why do you keep watching?
3	#	And then you flush.
3	#	You know, sometimes people won't go in a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.
3	#	Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.
3	#	It's your house.
3	#	Casus belli.
3	#	It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.
3	#	Have you gone in there?
3	#	Sure, fine.
3	#	Casus belli.
3	#	Since when do you wear cologne?
3	#	What IQ test?
3	#	It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?
3	#	Oh, that sounds like fun.
3	#	You'll do well, you're smart.
3	#	Wha'd you get on your SAT's?
3	#	huh, Mine's 145.
3	#	You get out of here!
3	#	Huhuhuhuhuhuhu (laughing)
3	#	Huh.
3	#	What?
3	#	Are you serious?
3	#	Where would I take the test?
3	#	No, that'd be too noisy.
3	#	Hey, what do you think?
3	#	Yeah, that's what is, isn't it? A caper. Huh.
3	#	What the hey.
3	#	What's been going on out there? I've been standing here 20 minutes.
3	#	All right, what time do you want me back here.
3	#	Ok.
3	#	All right.
3	#	Oh, no no no. I'll just have a tea and toast. (sits down across the table from Jerry)
3	#	Um, ok, ah well I'll have the, th-ri-rigatoni.
3	#	I know.
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Ok,
3	#	Yeah, ok... (takes the test and moves to another table.)
3	#	Statute.
3	#	Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a lot of time.
3	#	An IQ test.
3	#	It's for George.
3	#	Yeah, can-look ... can I explain it to you later?
3	#	Would you please?!
3	#	Later!
3	#	Yes, yes! (Jerry shaking his head, like he can't believe what he's seeing)
3	#	Babu! Ba-If-if ya don't mind?
3	#	Set.
3	#	Oh my God! It's all over the test!
3	#	Oh man! Look at this... I'm out of time anyway.
3	#	Uhh.
3	#	It was an accident.
3	#	Babu Bhatt did it.
3	#	You're very special.
3	#	Just give it back to him.
3	#	85?
3	#	He's coming up?
3	#	Yeah, but an 85, Jerry, that's ridiculous.
3	#	George, I cannot believe...
3	#	No there has got be a mistake.
3	#	Listen, there were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.
3	#	Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.
3	#	Oh, come on, come on. I?ll guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?
3	#	No, no, come on. I guarantee it.
3	#	Ok, now where I'm going to take it.
3	#	(stretching) Oh Man... Uunh.
3	#	What are you doing?
3	#	What's going on?
3	#	Wha'd you come in here for?
3	#	Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.
3	#	I had to take it again.
3	#	What's the difference?!!
3	#	What?
3	#	Well eh, kind of....
3	#	Oh.
3	#	Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.
3	#	Actually, you know I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entrate.
3	#	Hey guys...
3	#	I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.
3	#	Yeah..heheah (laughing a bit)
3	#	No, Chinese.
3	#	Hi boys.
3	#	What's happening?
3	#	What did she say?
3	#	So did you hear this message?
3	#	Really!
3	#	Huh! Sexy?
3	#	Like ...humm...How did she sound?
3	#	Really , like a... like a....(leans over to George and whispers) Jerry, I want to slide my tongue around you like a snake.....Ooooooooooha ,oooooohaaaa.....
3	#	Shhhhhh!!!
3	#	I stopped at the club to see him and I was standing in the back while he was on, right?, and there was this tape recorder there and I.....got this impulse. Ha Ha Ha Ha....What?
3	#	Now listen , promise me you won't tell him Okay.I want to have a little fun with this.
3	#	Oh! That was nothing. So listen, what about this bald thing?
3	#	So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?
3	#	I don't know.
3	#	Oh! really.
3	#	So what, Are you gonna ask her out.
3	#	Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.
3	#	Home.
3	#	Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.
3	#	(coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off the George Washington Bridge.
3	#	No.
3	#	( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.
3	#	Aah! Okaaay.
3	#	( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?
3	#	Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.
3	#	Thanks for driving me home. What did I do to deserve this?
3	#	Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?
3	#	Pffft....there's really nothing to do.
3	#	Do you think of anything?..
3	#	I am up for anything.
3	#	I was just kiddin, around.......
3	#	( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.
3	#	Okay...Thanks a lot for the ride.
3	#	It's Elaine Marie Benes.
3	#	Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?
3	#	I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?
3	#	Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?
3	#	Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.
3	#	So humm....When you gonna call her?
3	#	Good luck.
3	#	Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?
3	#	(Concerned) What's the matter?
3	#	(to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)
3	#	I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.
3	#	You told him!!!!
3	#	That was nothing.
3	#	What is it?
3	#	It was a joke...
3	#	Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons, all looking at her with lust.) I think I'll get going...
3	#	Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?
3	#	Are you coming with me?
3	#	He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.
3	#	Kramer!
3	#	How could you say something like that?!
3	#	No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.
3	#	What did you have to say that for?
3	#	Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.
3	#	(barging in) Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?
3	#	You encouraged her to get one.
3	#	Peter Jennings had one?
3	#	Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.
3	#	I think it's a mistake.
3	#	How do you even know the jacket is there?
3	#	Are you sure you want us here for this?
3	#	It looks good.
3	#	How ya feeling?
3	#	Can I get you anything?
3	#	You sure? Anything?
3	#	No, it didn't. No, it didn't.
3	#	Seems to be.
3	#	Shut up, George.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to the hospital.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	What do I need this for?
3	#	We're engaged?
3	#	Kramer, this is too big.
3	#	Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.
3	#	I heard him contend that.
3	#	Oh, it was a frame-up.
3	#	Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.
3	#	How kind of you.
3	#	Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
3	#	My father, really? I had no idea.
3	#	I found it!
3	#	Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"
3	#	Yeah, pretty much.
3	#	Hi!
3	#	So, will I see you later tonight?
3	#	(after they leave) Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have though she's like--
3	#	Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.
3	#	How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my mind.
3	#	How old are you?
3	#	Whatever you want.
3	#	Yeah, me too.
3	#	Oh, excuse me. (gets up to talk with Jerry) What have you been doing, I've been smacking myself senseless. People think I'm a mental patient.
3	#	This guy's going off on the peanut. Now pay attention.
3	#	Maybe the dingo ate your baby.
3	#	The dingo ate your baby!
3	#	Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.
3	#	Excuse me.
3	#	Really? Huh. What a world. So we can go now?
3	#	Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?
3	#	You don't know?
3	#	Oh great, oh, this is great. How could you let him take the car?
3	#	(noticing Ava in a fur) Oh look at that. Look at what she's wearing. You see what she's wearing?
3	#	I can't believe she's walking around in that.
3	#	Hey, is that real fur?
3	#	You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so that you can look good?
3	#	Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.
3	#	Fish don't feel any pain.
3	#	Well, they're not kept in little cages.
3	#	Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish. They're not unhappy.
3	#	Oh yeah, that's right. Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a squirrel!
3	#	Call Kramer.
3	#	You sure you don't need any help?
3	#	Call him again.
3	#	Six hundred and twenty million people died.
3	#	Thousand. Six hundred and twenty thousand. The horror, the horror. (To Jerry) The wife keeps giving us dirty looks. Are you sure you gave him the right directions?
3	#	Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for some reason.
3	#	Thanks a lot.
3	#	Then how did you find the place?
3	#	But it's cold out.
3	#	I brought you chicken soup. (To Patti) Is that real fur?
3	#	I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading from one of his novels.
3	#	Well, he's not a baseball player.
3	#	Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.
3	#	He's sixty-six years old.
3	#	Well, go, go.
3	#	Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd really like him.
3	#	What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?
3	#	What?
3	#	Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm not really saying anything at all?
3	#	Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.
3	#	What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?
3	#	I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being with him.
3	#	I just don't enjoy being with him.
3	#	I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?
3	#	Seven?
3	#	Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?
3	#	Hmm... How's the pasta over there?
3	#	Today?!
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	He was laughing?!
3	#	Get out!
3	#	So was Mia Farrow there?
3	#	What's your line?
3	#	Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."
3	#	I'm gonna go break up with Owen.
3	#	Call an ambulance.
3	#	We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.
3	#	Tell then to hurry! Hurry!
3	#	I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance, does anyone know first aid?
3	#	What extremities?
3	#	Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.
3	#	Well use a paper towel.
3	#	No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.
3	#	No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the table.
3	#	He is not a drug addict!
3	#	A cookie!
3	#	How's he gonna chew it?
3	#	Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.
3	#	You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
3	#	Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.
3	#	Where is the ambulance?!
3	#	I can't believe what's going on out here.
3	#	He seems to be breathing.
3	#	I know.
3	#	Almost.
3	#	It's not an easy thing to bring up.
3	#	Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.
3	#	He does, how'd you know that?
3	#	What happened, what took you so long?!
3	#	This guy I'm seeing.
3	#	Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'
3	#	Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy it when I read to him.
3	#	So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from the community.
3	#	Of course there's a community.
3	#	Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we* could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh, feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff. Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um, well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here. It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These pretzels are making me thirsty.
3	#	Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?
3	#	No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today, it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.
3	#	Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for sex.
3	#	Aww.
3	#	Jerry, George, what are you doing here?
3	#	*gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
3	#	Where did you find it?
3	#	And you stopped by just to give it to me?
3	#	I though I'd never find it.
3	#	No. Today's *your* lucky day.
3	#	You want to work here?
3	#	Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.
3	#	(softly to Dick) Dick.
3	#	My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.
3	#	And vodka.
3	#	Where's my drink?
3	#	No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.
3	#	Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.
3	#	One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
3	#	He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.
3	#	No. I can't smell it.
3	#	You don't always smell someone from a drink.
3	#	What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
3	#	I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.
3	#	Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
3	#	Hey what's that?
3	#	Christmas present? For who?
3	#	*gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.
3	#	(opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?
3	#	Oh, I love cashmere.
3	#	My, George this must have cost a fortune.
3	#	Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?
3	#	George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.
3	#	What?
3	#	Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
3	#	What don't you know?
3	#	Well do you see it or don't you?
3	#	Do you see it or don't you?
3	#	You're still here. You're a dynamo.
3	#	I'll see you tomorrow.
3	#	Dick was fired.
3	#	You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?
3	#	I'm not saying anything.
3	#	What could I be saying?
3	#	If I was saying something I would have said it.
3	#	I said it.
3	#	Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.
3	#	Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.
3	#	Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.
3	#	How much did he save?
3	#	Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?
3	#	You did didn't you.
3	#	Well Jerry told me that you did.
3	#	You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
3	#	No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
3	#	Well that's not sex.
3	#	Kissing is not sex.
3	#	Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?
3	#	What are you doing here?
3	#	Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
3	#	So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.
3	#	Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
3	#	Ow, ow move over.
3	#	I've got no room.
3	#	Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?
3	#	Ok, what time is your job interview George?
3	#	All right, I'm gonna go.
3	#	930
3	#	Yeah, they flip a coin.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	I can't. I'm the best man.
3	#	See'ya.
3	#	It's ironic.
3	#	This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this progress, but you know we've lost the little things, the niceties.
3	#	Oh...
3	#	A wedding.
3	#	Yeah
3	#	You're telling me.
3	#	Oh, very nice.
3	#	She.
3	#	There is no he.
3	#	Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.
3	#	Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.
3	#	No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian!
3	#	Too bad.
3	#	Get that out of my face.
3	#	George?
3	#	Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)
3	#	I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking... How do they warm up their fingers?
3	#	*No*, we would have heard it.
3	#	Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...
3	#	Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I started laughing.
3	#	We did. We're just hanging out.
3	#	Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?
3	#	Have you thought about an intervention?
3	#	You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.
3	#	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!
3	#	I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
3	#	[To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.
3	#	When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.
3	#	He's good.
3	#	Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told him that he should do an intervention.
3	#	Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.
3	#	Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.
3	#	All right.
3	#	Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.
3	#	Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.
3	#	Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
3	#	I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.
3	#	Yeah
3	#	What? How?
3	#	So? What happened?
3	#	Shut up!
3	#	Whar about Kramer?
3	#	(very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?
3	#	What's the order?
3	#	Albano is your last name.
3	#	Hide!
3	#	Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.
3	#	You're getting warm.
3	#	Oh, hi Noel
3	#	(Chuckles)
3	#	(laughs)
3	#	No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.
3	#	Na.
3	#	Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?
3	#	I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?
3	#	Hey, have you ever fasted?
3	#	What guy?
3	#	Oh, that creepy guy?
3	#	Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
3	#	Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.
3	#	Uh uh, you should go some time.
3	#	I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
3	#	Really?
3	#	Why would he come to George?
3	#	Take it away.
3	#	Should you be smoking?
3	#	Youre pregnant.
3	#	Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
3	#	Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.
3	#	Its disgusting.
3	#	Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.
3	#	(jumps with fear to Jerry) Did you see that wall move?
3	#	Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.
3	#	How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?
3	#	Kramer
3	#	And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.
3	#	Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.
3	#	Its Elaine.
3	#	I know.
3	#	I hate the good ones.
3	#	That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.
3	#	You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.
3	#	Well, at least you're not bitter.
3	#	Aren't you too young to be bitter?
3	#	Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.
3	#	So what'd you do last night?
3	#	Went out with Cynthia.
3	#	Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?
3	#	I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.
3	#	Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.
3	#	I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?
3	#	I didn't say it.
3	#	Who is he?
3	#	She's Cynthia!
3	#	What, you don't think she's beautiful?
3	#	You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.
3	#	That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
3	#	He can really do that?
3	#	What, are you into this?
3	#	No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?
3	#	Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?
3	#	What if it worked out?
3	#	He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-
3	#	Well, um, he, he got fired.
3	#	Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.
3	#	Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.
3	#	No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.
3	#	Pardon?
3	#	Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.
3	#	Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.
3	#	No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.
3	#	Yup.

3	#	Alright. Goodnight.
3	#	Oh my god.
3	#	But he used a condom, right?
3	#	Oh no.
3	#	Was it blue?
3	#	Just a hunch.
3	#	No thanks.
3	#	Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.
3	#	Her type? What type?
3	#	You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!
3	#	She's not bitter!
3	#	Twisted? God, I did you a favor.
3	#	Are you calling me a liar?
3	#	Are you?
3	#	You get yours out, I was here first!
3	#	Get it out!
3	#	I knew those condoms were defective!
3	#	Because! Because she missed her period!

3	#	Very mature.
3	#	Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.

3	#	What's the difference?
3	#	Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.
3	#	I'm sorry honey.
3	#	No,
3	#	I know.
3	#	Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to call.
3	#	You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?
3	#	Why don't you just go ahead and call him?
3	#	Just ask him if he wants a to get together.
3	#	Dinner's good.
3	#	Jerry, He's A GUY!
3	#	Jerry, ... He's a GUY!

3	#	Why?
3	#	What was it?
3	#	Wow! What a story.

3	#	Just in those commercials.
3	#	What's that?
3	#	Huh?
3	#	Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
3	#	He did.
3	#	I don't know.
3	#	Yeah. He said, um, he said it's really important that we call them O'Brien and Murphy.
3	#	Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?
3	#	Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.
3	#	What's going on?
3	#	Oh, can't, I'm going to the Knicks-Bulls game.
3	#	Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
3	#	I'm sure he was just joking around.
3	#	What is it?
3	#	Jerry's a nazi?!
3	#	Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.
3	#	No, he's just neat.
3	#	What?
3	#	What about his comedy act?
3	#	What about George?
3	#	I'll bet they were even in on it.
3	#	Kramer, you're hurting me!
3	#	Get off of me!!
3	#	It could be very confusing.
3	#	Look, it's Dan! Hi Dan!
3	#	Hey!
3	#	You know it's bad enough you have a car phone, you have to use the speaker?
3	#	What's goin' on?
3	#	Did you get a thank you wave?
3	#	Jerry, are you free on Friday?
3	#	Ah, God, I bumped into Robin Sandusky today, she asked me to have dinner with her and her husband.
3	#	You gotta follow that car!
3	#	You can't let him get away with that!
3	#	What are you, yellow?
3	#	Jerry, if you don't follow him, you're yella.
3	#	What? What? I can't hear you. Jerry?
3	#	It's me!
3	#	Hey!
3	#	Sweater.
3	#	So? What happened?
3	#	With the car!
3	#	The hit and run!
3	#	Queens?! You followed him over the bridge?
3	#	So? Then what?
3	#	I am speechless. I am without speech.
3	#	What shoving?!
3	#	You know karate??
3	#	Well, this is so, amazing to me! Jerry what did do?
3	#	Did you tell Kramer?
3	#	Jerry saw this guy crash into a car, and he followed him.
3	#	Hey Kramer, Kramer!
3	#	What happened to you right here? (She pointing to her forehead)
3	#	Well, that is, that is strange.
3	#	Alright, oh Jerry, we're still on for Friday night, right?
3	#	But last night you said you were free! (Sounding very disappointed)
3	#	But I, I can't go alone!
3	#	George, come on! I'll pay for you.
3	#	Because I hate being at a table alone, with a married couple. Talking about their married friends, and their married furniture. They're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine. You know, I have a very exciting life. It's very exciting. (As she's closing the door to leave)
3	#	Yes, well, an ex-bullfighter now.
3	#	His name? Name, um, his name was uh, uh, Eduardo Carochio.
3	#	Um, actually, I met him in Switzerland, and he was fighting uh, is that the word they use? Fighting? Because they don't really fight the bull, they avoid fighting the bull.
3	#	I just love meeting new people. You know that's how you really do learn about life.
3	#	It's me.
3	#	Hi!
3	#	Well! If it isn't mister gesuntheit!
3	#	What does it mean anyway? 'God bless you'. It's a stupid 'stuperstition'.
3	#	Whatever.
3	#	Yeah, yeah, that's better than 'God bless you'. Anyway, she left a message on my machine, she wants you to call her.
3	#	Robin!
3	#	Well I assumed she called to apologize, that's why she called me.
3	#	Hey, grab Jerry's sweater for me, would you?
3	#	Chilly out.
3	#	Yeah, you can take a sweater if you want to.
3	#	Nah, hey, shut this off, shut it off.
3	#	What?
3	#	Hey, hey, wait a minute! Let me ask you something. Kramer, the last time you hit your head, was Mary Hart on TV?
3	#	That is it!
3	#	That is it! Mary Hart's voice, don't you see? There's something about Mary Hart's voice that's giving you seizures. Just like, just like, just like that woman in Albany!
3	#	What?
3	#	Married women don't 'get together'. They have affairs.
3	#	Are you actually considering this?
3	#	Yeah, it's like hitting a car and driving away without leaving a note.
3	#	Well I've got to get going. I'm meeting a guy with grey sweatpants.
3	#	Hi, Michael!
3	#	Robin? No, why?
3	#	No I haven't spoken to her all day-uh, yeah right, um, as a matter of fact, um, she was here, and she uh, left a note, but I wasn't here, but I have the note, uh, right here.
3	#	Well I, I don't know.
3	#	No, no, come on Michael!
3	#	You're soo good lookin'.
3	#	Very nice meeting you!
3	#	Come on up.
3	#	Well, well, well, Mr. Seinfeld! That must have been so frightening! When you confronted that guy, in Queens! Now, let's just see if I've got this scenario right.
3	#	No, no, no, no, no. Because I'm picturing 'French Connection', kind of thing. You know? Sort of a Popeye Doyle chase through the city!
3	#	Oh no, no, come on. Don't be so modest!
3	#	Oh, did you check you machine?
3	#	Michael called me today, and he asked me where Robin was.
3	#	And I said I hadn't seen her.
3	#	No, no George! You don't understand! She didn't tell me she was using me as an excuse! Okay?! But then I realized what was going on, and I said that she left a note. Um, but he didn't really buy that. And then, and then he did mention your name.
3	#	He said he was going to sew your ass to your face.
3	#	Well I don't know, he caught me off guard!
3	#	Well who told you to sleep with her George?!
3	#	Oh Gosh! None of this would never have happened if you wouldn't have said 'God bless you'!
3	#	Uh, Eduardo, uh, Carochio.
3	#	Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.
3	#	Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.
3	#	I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
3	#	(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?
3	#	Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)
3	#	Hi!
3	#	Great, great.
3	#	(thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!
3	#	You're not serious.
3	#	Well, did he say that?
3	#	Well maybe you should ask him!
3	#	No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!
3	#	George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!
3	#	Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.
3	#	No!
3	#	(sarcastically, to George) Stay!
3	#	...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!
3	#	Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!
3	#	I know! Can you imagine that?
3	#	Wha- a picture?
3	#	OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??
3	#	(gasps) I cannot believe this!
3	#	Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting my father! Oh my g-I make up one little white lie and they put my picture in the paper!
3	#	Hi, Mr. Lippman.
3	#	My, my father?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	I went to visit him.
3	#	Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...
3	#	Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says "boyed") his spirits.
3	#	What--what did I say?
3	#	I did?
3	#	Oh! Where are you going?
3	#	Ah. ...Yeah.
3	#	There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You know, the Yankees won, the Mets lost, Ricky Henderson's unhappy...
3	#	Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is the THIRD time today I have done that! BLAAAH! (laughs again) Grabbing news- papers... I'm just tugging at 'em... (laughs)
3	#	Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty! (beat) I'll just hold down the, uh, fort!
3	#	(on intercom) It's Elaine.
3	#	(to Nina) Hello!
3	#	(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!
3	#	No, he wants to torture me.
3	#	(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)
3	#	You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.
3	#	No, come on! I want it, Jerry!
3	#	Well at least let George do it!
3	#	It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.
3	#	What letter?
3	#	You know, it's not really that terrible.
3	#	Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.
3	#	Well, uh, fan. My father--
3	#	Really?
3	#	So... impudent.
3	#	(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--
3	#	(very reluctant) Okay.
3	#	That will be fun.
3	#	Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?
3	#	You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.
3	#	Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?
3	#	Are you sure you like these sunglasses?
3	#	Of course I hear that.
3	#	I wanted to check out my sunglasses.
3	#	Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	No, I really don't.
3	#	I'm sure you could.
3	#	I don't know.
3	#	Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.
3	#	Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.
3	#	Why?
3	#	I'll pay for it.
3	#	(pointing backwards) Oh George, there's a space right there!
3	#	You didn't even have to take it out to dinner.
3	#	Will you just park it already?
3	#	George, wait, you don't know who this guy is, people kill for a parking space in this city.
3	#	George?
3	#	Come on, we'll put it in a garage.
3	#	What are you gonna do, you just gonna leave it here like this? Uh. I'm going upstairs.
3	#	Yeah, I gotta tell Jerry we're here. I gotta go to the bathroom.
3	#	Me? No no no, you. You're gonna tell him. I'm not gonna tell- Noo.
3	#	What am I gonna say?
3	#	Oh god, I need a drink, do you got any Hennigan's here?
3	#	Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)
3	#	(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.
3	#	Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.
3	#	I think it was a gun. And then they followed us all the way into the city, and then they just stopped and they turned around and they went home.
3	#	Yeah, yeah, I'm alright. Oh, by the way, the car hit a pothole and now it's making a clanking noise.
3	#	Exactly.
3	#	Oh, he's out in front of the building. He's arguing with some guy about a parking space.
3	#	Look out the window, you'll see.
3	#	(desperate to distract Jerry) Ow!! (Jerry looks over) It's my cuticle.
3	#	Hi.
3	#	You know that guy downstairs?
3	#	Are you going down?
3	#	Is anything wrong?
3	#	(heading for the bathroom) Be down in a minute.
3	#	Yeah, it's all taken care of.
3	#	I did a number on him, it was a thing of beauty, you really had to have been there to appreciate it.
3	#	I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.
3	#	Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.
3	#	What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.
3	#	What?
3	#	Oh, so that's why you were acting so funny.
3	#	We just didn't think of you.
3	#	Kramer? I'm so sorry, really.
3	#	You see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right? But these guys don't trust each other so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
3	#	Yeah. I know, I said to myself, 'Why us?' You remember?
3	#	Right.
3	#	Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.
3	#	Why don't you just flip a coin already?
3	#	You know, maybe if you hadn't been sitting there pontificating about what a great parker you were, you might have got the space.
3	#	What?
3	#	He thinks you're a phony?
3	#	Oh, you have to say something.
3	#	You gotta open the vault.
3	#	Open your vault.
3	#	You have no choice.
3	#	It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?
3	#	Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.
3	#	I will.
3	#	I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?
3	#	Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.
3	#	Oh, I'm not, uh...
3	#	Jerry, give him the keys back.
3	#	Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
3	#	That's ridiculous.
3	#	I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
3	#	Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
3	#	Cause he gave me his.
3	#	So, if he has my keys, I should have his.
3	#	I just said the same thing to you.
3	#	What?
3	#	Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. (George begins to leaf through papers on Elaine's counter.) What are you doing? Would you just put that down? (Takes the papers away from George.) I gotta get some new friends.
3	#	What's going on?
3	#	Yeah, yeah, I saw it. (mutters under her breath) I mean, it's complete bullshit.
3	#	What...?
3	#	Nothing. I didn't say anything.
3	#	Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.
3	#	I didn't say anything.
3	#	You weasels!
3	#	How dare you!
3	#	Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through all my things? You thought it was funny?
3	#	You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
3	#	Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!
3	#	No, you can't be trusted!
3	#	Good! I won't!
3	#	These aren't my keys!
3	#	I don't know!
3	#	I just thought I could write it.
3	#	I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
3	#	O.K., can I just watch the show? (mutters under her breath) God, what an asshole.
3	#	I didn't say anything.
3	#	Who's faking?
3	#	Faking what?
3	#	Ah! Orgasm?
3	#	How do you know?
3	#	Of course.
3	#	On occasion.
3	#	No.
3	#	Because I was gooood.
3	#	You didn't know.
3	#	You didn't know.
3	#	Well...
3	#	Ye.
3	#	Yeass.
3	#	Yeass.
3	#	I faked it.
3	#	Not bad huh?
3	#	(points in the air as is to point out each things Jerry asked) Fake, fake, fake, fake.
3	#	Uuuhm, all the time.
3	#	Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.
3	#	I'm sure they're not.
3	#	So we're having dinner tonight?
3	#	Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?
3	#	Nooo, the other thing.
3	#	Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.
3	#	Okay.
3	#	All right, see you later.
3	#	Bye.
3	#	Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something Ummm, have you ever... you know... faked it?
3	#	Really, like when?
3	#	Oh god, Mmmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmmmm, Mmm, Ah, Woo
3	#	Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?
3	#	You don't like her?
3	#	I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.
3	#	I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.
3	#	What's the matter?
3	#	You're not still thinking about that are you?
3	#	Oh good.
3	#	(shocked) What?
3	#	You mean...?
3	#	Oooh no, I don't think so.
3	#	Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.
3	#	Jerry no, that's important to me.
3	#	Ya, Yes we will!
3	#	No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.
3	#	No!
3	#	Noo!
3	#	What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.
3	#	That is so ridiculous.
3	#	No.
3	#	No!
3	#	I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
3	#	Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
3	#	Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?
3	#	I'm really, really sorry I told you that.
3	#	Well stop being such a baby.
3	#	You're a baby!
3	#	Hi George.
3	#	Noo, thanks.
3	#	Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.
3	#	I know.
3	#	I'm waiting.
3	#	Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
3	#	They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
3	#	All right and that just about... does it.
3	#	Okay, welp... see you around.
3	#	All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.
3	#	Come on!
3	#	Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.
3	#	You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?
3	#	Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! (Laughs)
3	#	What's that?
3	#	Yep. Yeah..
3	#	(Interested) Oh?
3	#	Oh, a puffy shirt.
3	#	Uh, o... (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.
3	#	Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a (pauses) benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the (clears her throat) poor, and the homeless..
3	#	And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.
3	#	Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.
3	#	Yep.
3	#	Mmm
3	#	Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
3	#	Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit!
3	#	(Between laughs) What is that?!
3	#	(To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?
3	#	When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?
3	#	I didn't hear anything.
3	#	(Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear that on the show.
3	#	(Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry) Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up!.. You look like the Count of Monte Cristo!
3	#	(Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna.. swing in on a chandelier!
3	#	Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see.
3	#	(Obviously not impressed, dull) Yeah, real nice.
3	#	You ready?
3	#	(Sincere) I'm sorry.
3	#	(Reflecting) Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee.
3	#	Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
3	#	No. Do you ever think about it?
3	#	Me too.
3	#	What air conditioner?
3	#	I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
3	#	Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice) Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.
3	#	You don't have an old pair?
3	#	George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health club pool?
3	#	Yeah, especially those frames.
3	#	They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of them.
3	#	Now those look good, they're very bold.
3	#	Hi there, little doggy. (to owner) Do you mind if I pet your dog?
3	#	Hey little doggy. (Elaine pets the dog and he bites her) Aaah!
3	#	I'm okay, it's just a nip.
3	#	My leg looks pretty bad.
3	#	Okay.
3	#	(pulling on Jerry's pants from the ground) Jerry, can we go?
3	#	Jerry, my leg.
3	#	Okay, listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow the trail of blood.
3	#	Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!
3	#	Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses on!
3	#	So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
3	#	Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
3	#	No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?
3	#	There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't come in until he left.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	I'm afraid of dogs now.
3	#	Well he frightened me.
3	#	No. He said I didn't need a shot.
3	#	What, you think I should have?
3	#	All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.
3	#	You know, George, that's an onion.
3	#	He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
3	#	Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
3	#	Can I just have the name...
3	#	(While reading a book) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen to these symptoms for rabies anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!
3	#	Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!
3	#	I'm sorry... sorry.
3	#	I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!
3	#	I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, you stupid hipster dufus!
3	#	I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.
3	#	I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't swallow.
3	#	Is this gonna hurt?
3	#	What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?
3	#	Let me tell you this there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy. He looks like a horse!
3	#	Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window) Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams) Hey! Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!
3	#	No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.
3	#	What do you think?
3	#	Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a lot.
3	#	Nothing, and I've looked.
3	#	In the office.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.
3	#	Ask your mother, (making fun of George's living situation) you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through his thumb and his forefinger like this.
3	#	I said "So, what do you think?". And he said, "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
3	#	Yeah...Jake Jarmel.
3	#	Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. (taps on the window)
3	#	Hi.
3	#	Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
3	#	Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?
3	#	Wow, look at that ring.
3	#	See what?
3	#	What?
3	#	I don't know.
3	#	Oh, no! Come on Jerry.
3	#	No, I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.
3	#	Maybe it's the cold weather.
3	#	(making fun of George as he leaves) Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.
3	#	Hello.... hello, oh...
3	#	You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making dinner. You're perfect, you're a perfect man.
3	#	Did anyone call?
3	#	Where are they?
3	#	Thank you. (looking at the messages) Oh ya, heh, I'll call you back. Ooh, Myra had the baby! Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?
3	#	She did? Oh, that's so great!
3	#	In the drawer on the right. Hmm...
3	#	Nah it's nothing.
3	#	It's nothing.
3	#	Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?
3	#	See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby", but you didn't use an exclamation point.
3	#	So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.
3	#	Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.
3	#	You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.
3	#	I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.
3	#	Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!
3	#	Why?
3	#	Well, I felt a call for one.
3	#	I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.
3	#	Oh, he's not on drugs.
3	#	All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing right now.
3	#	So what?
3	#	People go to South America.
3	#	So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an entire continent?
3	#	Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.
3	#	Ohh, what are you gonna do? You gonna put on phony beards and dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean come on...
3	#	You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?
3	#	Yes (clears her throat) yes I did.
3	#	Uh well um, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and intensity.
3	#	Right, well...
3	#	That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...
3	#	Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...
3	#	Ok, ok ok ...
3	#	...ok I'll just....
3	#	You still have no proof.
3	#	The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! See, I told you he wasn't a drug addict.
3	#	You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.
3	#	What is this?
3	#	He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why is he filing a chapter eleven?
3	#	What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.
3	#	Whoa.
3	#	First the sucking then the weaning.
3	#	Must wean.
3	#	Did you give him the room number?
3	#	I'm taking a cab home. I can't this anymore.
3	#	Huuh, Wow.
3	#	What?
3	#	That's great Kramer... So-So, anyway, tell us what's involved in being a Godparent.
3	#	Wha, Kramer. It's a tradition.
3	#	A Mohel! What the hell is a Mohel?
3	#	Where am I going to find a Mohel? (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES, MUTTERING) Motels, models... How do you find a Mohel?
3	#	Hey Jerry, you ever seen one?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Ya.
3	#	(shakes her head) No, had no face, no personality. It was like a martian. But hey, you know that's me.
3	#	Well I have to interview a Mohel.
3	#	Are you alright?
3	#	If I hear about this pig-man one more time...
3	#	(MUMBLES) That's just about enough
3	#	Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.
3	#	Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.
3	#	He'll be here.
3	#	Relax. You'd think you were getting whacked.
3	#	I thought pitchers and catchers did have a special rapport.
3	#	What about me? I mean I just watched a few games with her sitting in the stands.
3	#	Yes it is level jumping.
3	#	Kramer, what's the matter with you?
3	#	(to everyone) Oh, that's the Mohel.
3	#	Hello.
3	#	Did you find the place alright?
3	#	(setting down her glass) Oh, ya haha.
3	#	(to Myra) He's very highly recommended. So...
3	#	(pushing Jerry over to the Mohel) Ok, go.
3	#	Go.
3	#	C'mon
3	#	Ok.
3	#	You flinched.
3	#	Oh how would he know. He blacked out. He fainted.
3	#	Would you stop it? You're just gonna need a few stitches.
3	#	I said I'm sorry.
3	#	Jerry, be careful. The Mohel's got a knife!
3	#	Oh, how's the baby?
3	#	You really do the worst Godfather I ever heard. You're not even close.
3	#	But I didn't do anything.
3	#	(annoyed) Uh, you are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
3	#	Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, and the driver is way up there on the stage.
3	#	Yea, I guess that could work.
3	#	Pardon me?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	You know I-I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back here. So...
3	#	I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
3	#	What?
3	#	It can be very frustrating.
3	#	Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know you gotta live your life.
3	#	Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love him.
3	#	(realizing he caught her) Yeah. Yes it does...
3	#	No no, no no.
3	#	Hey.
3	#	What is this about?
3	#	You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.
3	#	Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.
3	#	No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.
3	#	Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, see, because I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.
3	#	Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?
3	#	Really?
3	#	Oh great, thanks Kramer.
3	#	Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
3	#	Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.
3	#	I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape it?
3	#	Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
3	#	So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
3	#	I beg to differ.
3	#	He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong the spoils.
3	#	Well we can take the car service from my office.
3	#	Yeah, they don't know.
3	#	She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow afternoon?
3	#	It's so amazing getting to see Monica Seles playing in the finals.
3	#	Hmm!
3	#	They put real blue berries in this. And there's real blue berries. What kind did you get?
3	#	Let me test-taste that. (tastes Jerry's yogurt)
3	#	Hmm! Rico!
3	#	(offering her yogurt to George) You want to taste mine?
3	#	No, I don't.
3	#	All right, let's just forget it.
3	#	All right, we should get going. But, I'm going to get a little bit more, okay?
3	#	Hi!
3	#	Hi!
3	#	Nice to meet you, too!
3	#	(excited about Lloyd) Aaah. Boy, he is really cute!
3	#	(on the buzzer) Buzz me.
3	#	Hey!
3	#	Oh, I was having lunch, and I bit down on the fork.
3	#	What?
3	#	(quietly) What?
3	#	Where's your bathroom scale? (Jerry looks at her like 'where do you think?' Elaine and Jerry both go into the bathroom) Oh my god, I've gained seven pounds.
3	#	Oh, my god! A couple, but 7 pounds. How did I gain 7 pounds?
3	#	I don't get it. I, I've been doing the same exercises. I haven't been eating anything different.
3	#	I don't eat Oreos.
3	#	Jerry, there's got to be a way to find that out.
3	#	AH! I've got it.
3	#	I'll call the Food and Drug Administration.
3	#	Uh-huh. Okay, well, we're coming down. All right. (hangs up the phone) Okay. I got a place that can analyze it. It's in Brooklyn. We have to drive there.
3	#	Yeah, it's forty-five bucks.
3	#	Hm-hmm.
3	#	I want a small, plain vanilla in a cup to go. That's non-fat, right?
3	#	Cause I'm on a special diet, and the doctor said I can't have any fat.
3	#	Hurry, Jerry! Hurry!
3	#	Not so good.
3	#	Um, hi! Hi. I called earlier about getting the yogurt tested.
3	#	Uh, does it matter if it's melted?
3	#	That's okay.
3	#	Okay, I'm done.
3	#	It smells. Smells bad. Smells really bad.
3	#	What?
3	#	Hey!
3	#	So, guess who called me.
3	#	We're going out tomorrow night.
3	#	I can't say that.
3	#	What if I like him? I'm going to start out lying to this guy?
3	#	No. But what if we get married or something? We'll always have that between us.
3	#	You never know.
3	#	All right, well, then what if we become a couple, George? Every time we see you you're going to be walking around going like this? (moving her arm) Even you can't keep that up.
3	#	You know, Lloyd advises Dinkins on everything he does.
3	#	He tells him which soap to use.
3	#	Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?
3	#	Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.
3	#	Well, everybody would know everybody. It would be like a small town.
3	#	Really? Wow.
3	#	No, I'm watching my weight.
3	#	Yeah, so they say.
3	#	Yeah. Okay.
3	#	Three days and he hasn't called me, and you know why? Because he thinks I'm too fat.
3	#	(stands up straight) No, but I saw the look on his face when he put his arm around me. And then we went to his apartment, and I sat on one of his chairs and it broke. And he says, "Boy, you're a lot of woman!"
3	#	No. What about him?
3	#	Un-huh.
3	#	Jerry, come on, look. Let's go over to that yogurt store.
3	#	(pointing to Kramer) Now look what you've done.
3	#	Oh, it stinks.
3	#	Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported. Ironically, the mishap by bringing the non-fat yogurt scandal to the attention of the public, probably clinched the election for the Republican. It was the one issue which seemed to electrify the voters and swept Giuliani into office.
3	#	I wonder what actually happened in that lab.
3	#	"I want you to have this job, of course the Board of Directors is under indictment and will be serving time."
3	#	Why don't you go ahead and call him?
3	#	Good for you.
3	#	What butcher?
3	#	You never get good haircuts.
3	#	Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one to look good for my bachelor auction.
3	#	Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors for charity.
3	#	Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
3	#	Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?
3	#	Oh yeah? Can I see it?
3	#	Come on. Let me see it.
3	#	Come on.
3	#	(still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
3	#	What? No Jerry, you have to go.
3	#	(dryly) Yeah, too bad.
3	#	Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.
3	#	Can he fix it?
3	#	What happened? It looks the same.
3	#	Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.
3	#	You can still go.
3	#	You think?
3	#	What would you wear?
3	#	Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.
3	#	A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a thousand three times, sold to the lucky lady in the third row. Congratulations, thank you so much.
3	#	Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's uh, he's a high school graduate.
3	#	Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. (Kramer dances up and down the stage) He's uh, self-employed. He's... I don't know, six foot three, 190 pounds, he likes, uh... fruit, and he just got uh, a haircut.
3	#	Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do I hear, um, five bucks?
3	#	It isn't?
3	#	Get out!
3	#	You remember the date?
3	#	Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.
3	#	Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)
3	#	Oh, yeah?
3	#	Joel...
3	#	Uh... (clears her throat) Rifkin.
3	#	Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.
3	#	Very funny. That's very funny.
3	#	All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.
3	#	(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!
3	#	The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
3	#	Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.
3	#	You can't ask a person to change their name.
3	#	Would you change yours?
3	#	Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?
3	#	You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.
3	#	O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.
3	#	You think I should have asked George?
3	#	Karen?
3	#	Oh! The Risotto broad.
3	#	I tought you didn't like double dates.
3	#	I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.
3	#	And you're taking...
3	#	Hey, did you get a massage yet?
3	#	Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.
3	#	So what?
3	#	(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?
3	#	Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.
3	#	Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.
3	#	Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.
3	#	Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!
3	#	Oh, you have photos in your wallet?
3	#	No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?
3	#	Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.
3	#	Yeah, there is, right here you see--
3	#	(pause) Oh. That's nice.
3	#	(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.
3	#	Of course I support your decision to change your name.
3	#	Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
3	#	(she fakes a strangling) RRR...
3	#	Yeah. Yeah. 10 names.
3	#	O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.
3	#	O.K. You start. What's your first choice?
3	#	(right away) No. Second choice.
3	#	I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.
3	#	(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.
3	#	Great...
3	#	I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.
3	#	Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go "Ahh". I mean every two seconds "Ahh". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone "Ahh". I had to drop the class.
3	#	What is wrong with Ned?
3	#	Ellis.
3	#	Ellis and Alex aren't even close.
3	#	Ohh, what is the point?
3	#	O.K. O.K. Remy.
3	#	Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.
3	#	(sniffing) Dandruff?
3	#	There's some kasha.
3	#	Alright, let's go, come on.
3	#	Yeah. You know we shouldn't have bowled that last game, I'm gonna be late.
3	#	Not any more. Come on, get your ball, we're leaving. Let's go, let's go.
3	#	(impatient) Come on!
3	#	I'm having people over.
3	#	The girls for poker night. You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...
3	#	Yeah. And she broke up with the vitamin guy.
3	#	I'll put in a good word for you.
3	#	Got it! C'mon, let's go, let's go. Bye George.
3	#	Now?!
3	#	Jerry, you promised you'd get me home by seven.
3	#	Oh! The subway? From Queens?
3	#	I need something to read on the subway.
3	#	(looks at it) TV Guide?
3	#	(engrossed in magazine) Hmm-mmm.
3	#	(still paying no attention) Hmm-mmm. First thing in the morning.
3	#	How are you gonna get something and get back on the train in time?
3	#	(laughing) No thanks.
3	#	Excuse me?
3	#	Ah. Uh, look really (looks about to try and avoid contact) I'm just trying to read.
3	#	He's not my boyfriend.
3	#	Oh, (nervous laugh) my stop. (making her escape) Bye-bye.
3	#	Knocked you out Jack. Pair of deuces
3	#	(triumphant) Ha, ha, ha ha!
3	#	Who is it?
3	#	Jerry!
3	#	What is this?
3	#	Oh, you did? (to girls) Oh, do you guys all know Jerry?
3	#	No.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	(examines card; embarrassed) That's very nice. Thank you very much.
3	#	I, I don't think so.
3	#	I, uh, I don't blame you Winona. I, uh...
3	#	Are you out of your mind?!
3	#	Winona is a Native American.
3	#	It's right over there.
3	#	You want it?
3	#	Yuh! You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
3	#	Aah, so Mr Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
3	#	He collects (holds up magazine) these?
3	#	Wow! Alright, well I will personally go out to Queens and deliver his Al Roker TV Guide to him.
3	#	I dunno.
3	#	Hi.
3	#	What did who say?
3	#	Uhmm...
3	#	Kramer, it is such a dumb idea. I would be (raising her voice as Kramer speaks his line) totally embarrassed to bring it...
3	#	I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
3	#	Hello. (she enters)
3	#	(placatory) I'm so sorry about that Mr Costanza, but look. Look, I brought you another one. (hands it over)
3	#	(accepts reluctantly) Oh, thank you.
3	#	Mr Lippman. I'm sorry, I was in Queens uh... (sees Kramer) Kramer!
3	#	What are you doing in here with that?
3	#	Well I (indistinct) ...manuscript that I...
3	#	I dunno.
3	#	I guess.
3	#	What d'you think is the matter? I've been assigned to work on Kramer's coffee table book.
3	#	I don't think so.
3	#	He's not my boyfriend.
3	#	We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then he put his hand on my heart.
3	#	Jerry, the man is a doctor.
3	#	So, its the same thing.
3	#	Really?
3	#	What?
3	#	Whats that? (points at some foil on the table)
3	#	Why?
3	#	Latvian Orthodox? (gasps) Mmm, it is lobster.
3	#	Mmm, this is delicious.
3	#	Why dont you just ask her parents?
3	#	I think it would be romantic.
3	#	Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne and marrying Mrs. Simpson. Ooh.
3	#	George I was just kidding around.
3	#	George I wasnt serious.
3	#	I guess this one is my fault.
3	#	I dont know.
3	#	So what did you say?
3	#	I don't know, what were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
3	#	You were snooping.
3	#	Well I trust people not to do that.
3	#	What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
3	#	I am not going to ask him about funguses.
3	#	You sure you dont mind?
3	#	Well I mean the question isnt even for me its for a friend.
3	#	Well podiatrist.
3	#	No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to medical school, you went to podiatry school. Which Im sure is very grueling in its own way.
3	#	I like feet too. Im just saying
3	#	No.
3	#	You took her medicine.
3	#	I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how podiatrists arent real doctors.
3	#	Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
3	#	Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
3	#	Do you think I should call him and apologize?
3	#	(kiss, kiss) You know, because I love the foot. Im a big fan of the foot.
3	#	And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie toe.
3	#	Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? Youre not going to the ear guy.

3	#	It's disgusting.
3	#	Really cold.
3	#	I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
3	#	(Laughing as she says it) What is that, ha?
3	#	Hey, you can't even turn around in that thing.
3	#	Hey George, can you feel this? Can you ...
3	#	Oh listen we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine or something.
3	#	These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
3	#	Because it's rude, otherwise.
3	#	Yes.
3	#	Ya can't bring Pepsi. (Elaine starts putting on her coat and gloves)
3	#	Because we're adults?
3	#	Jerry get off of me. Get off of ME! Get off, Get off of Me!
3	#	You know, I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one bottle of wine.
3	#	What?
3	#	We should bring some cake. Will you stop off at the bakery?
3	#	Ring Dings?
3	#	George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and Pepsi.
3	#	Oh, Kramer, thats the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.
3	#	Okay, let me out. You, eh, whatever your name is
3	#	Yeah, Jerry, Jerry -- come with me.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.
3	#	Mmm.
3	#	You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
3	#	Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
3	#	CHOCOLATE BABKA! That's their specialty.
3	#	Yeah, yeah!
3	#	Why?
3	#	You think it's effeminate?
3	#	Oh, we forgot to pick a number.
3	#	I-cu-di-ge--You think I should go and ask her for hers?
3	#	No, no no no, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't mean they were here first. We were here, and we were ahead of them, and them, and her. Come on let's just go ask em. Come on. . . . Excuse me.
3	#	But we were here ahead of you.
3	#	Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I make up stories to get ahead in lines at bakeries.
3	#	Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?
3	#	Oh my god. I, I know you. I-Im, I'm Elaine Benes. Do you remember we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.
3	#	Yeah me too.
3	#	Well, this is a little awkward, isn't it?
3	#	You know we were here, ahead of you.
3	#	Ohhh, OK, fine, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are.
3	#	I know. They're going in first with the last babka.
3	#	You can't beat a babka.
3	#	(exhales) They're going to be heroes.
3	#	Well how about a carrot cake?
3	#	Black Forrest?
3	#	Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. Might as well get Mengele.
3	#	What's this one?
3	#	(gasp)
3	#	No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with lesser babka.
3	#	I'll have a cinnamon babka.
3	#	Well your views on race relations are just, fascinating. You really should do an Op-Ed piece for the Times. (Op-Ed stands for Opinions and Editorials)
3	#	(looking in the box) Well what is this?
3	#	It's a hair.
3	#	No, we're late as it is. I'll just take it off.
3	#	Alright, alright.
3	#	Excuse me.
3	#	No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake with a (quietly) hair on it.
3	#	We waited fifteen minutes for this. Tst - YOU SELL ME A CAKE WITH A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry taking a number) youre gonna wait now?
3	#	Well it was a little hair. I took it off.
3	#	What if it's your hair?
3	#	(Wh-wh) What is wrong with my hair? Nobody takes better care of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.
3	#	Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.
3	#	No I'm bringing cake! (looking worried and apprehensive)
3	#	Why couldn't we just take the hair off and go?
3	#	Whhhy?
3	#	What happened?
3	#	You can't tell me?
3	#	You found a hair in your Farina?
3	#	What happened?
3	#	(quietly) Wow. Who's hair was it?
3	#	(quietly) Ahhhhh
3	#	Ooo, That's us. (hits Jerry in the arm)
3	#	You sold us a hair with a cake around it. We'd like another one.
3	#	Ah,
3	#	Okay. Alright we got the cake now. Where is George and Kramer?
3	#	Wait `til I get my hands on that George. I am gonna *pull* that big hood over his little head... tie the strings, and suffocate. You remember that Panama hat? That was nothing.
3	#	What's the matter with you?
3	#	What's wrong?
3	#	The black and white?
3	#	Not getting along?
3	#	(mocking - in a dopey voice) Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
3	#	Wait, what about your vomit streak?
3	#	Oh, oh! Ooh my god. Oh!
3	#	Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're doing you, LUNATIC! (the man turns and walks away)
3	#	(cont) ...uh, Jerry, I think he broke my toe. (Jerry gets up) W-Where're you going?
3	#	How was it?
3	#	Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to put up your...
3	#	Cinnamon babka.
3	#	Here, here's your cake. (just about tosses it at the woman)
3	#	See ya'.
3	#	(to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?
3	#	Yeah, I'm on the phone here.
3	#	No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.
3	#	Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?
3	#	(to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! thats fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. (Elaine jumps up and dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!
3	#	Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine!
3	#	Oh! (pushing Jerry) Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy!
3	#	... (looking at Jerry for a second then, mockingly nods her head back and forth) ....Ha ha ha ha.
3	#	But it's a line from that song!
3	#	Really?
3	#	What is this your mail? (She takes a magazine and starts flipping through it)
3	#	Oh! Your Alumni Magazine.
3	#	(gasp) Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come theres not anything about you in here?
3	#	All right (slaps the magazine down on the counter) this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. (heads for the door)
3	#	Yeah. (startled)
3	#	Its OK. (starts walking down the hallway)
3	#	What?
3	#	Wh..?
3	#	Wow!
3	#	Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer!
3	#	I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that...
3	#	...Are you sure you can't use this thing?
3	#	Where'd you get this?
3	#	Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)
3	#	Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?"
3	#	Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it
3	#	"War and Peace."
3	#	"War--What Is It Good For." (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe
3	#	(spoken to Testikov) that's a song
3	#	they-they took it from Tolstoy.
3	#	No its not. That really is true.
3	#	Yes it is
3	#	Oh, I
3	#	Oh It must be my new organizer.
3	#	Right, I think its this
3	#	OK. I dont quite know
3	#	Yeah, Im gonna work on that
3	#	Hey, "great" organizer you gave me.
3	#	It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.
3	#	I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.
3	#	What, what is it?
3	#	OK I'll see you later.
3	#	There you are!
3	#	So?
3	#	So what do you have to say for yourself?
3	#	"War-- What is it good for?"!
3	#	A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!
3	#	Uh-hu. And do you know what happened?
3	#	Oh, Please.
3	#	What, how did you know that?
3	#	(gasps) How did you find it?
3	#	(gasps) Where is it, give it to me!
3	#	Why not.
3	#	But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!
3	#	One million.
3	#	Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!
3	#	Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?
3	#	Well, you're not Superman.
3	#	Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder.
3	#	Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it.
3	#	Hi, (sighs) you got the organizer?
3	#	Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so
3	#	Hmm. (she nods in agreement)
3	#	(quietly) OK.
3	#	Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?
3	#	( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.
3	#	Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)
3	#	Oh thats nothing. Um and anyway um
3	#	No, No that's my purse!
3	#	No, get-get off my purse!
3	#	No that's Radio!
3	#	George Ive just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!
3	#	What, are you in a bad mood?
3	#	Ohhh! Golden Boy?
3	#	I'm sorry. (pats him on the arm)
3	#	Who wouldn't taste a pie?
3	#	Dump her.
3	#	(piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering me pie.
3	#	He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.
3	#	I got a pebble.
3	#	What the hell does that mean?
3	#	What? Why?
3	#	Like... (doing it) Like this?
3	#	What's me?
3	#	Get out!
3	#	I'm going down there.
3	#	(grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go.
3	#	It looks exactly like me.
3	#	What's going on here? How do you think this happened?
3	#	You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?
3	#	(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?
3	#	I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?
3	#	(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?
3	#	Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.
3	#	(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.
3	#	What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.
3	#	So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.
3	#	I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?
3	#	We certainly have.
3	#	No way!
3	#	No.
3	#	Kramer, forget it.
3	#	I thought George was meeting us here?
3	#	He's guarding a suit?
3	#	So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.
3	#	There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.
3	#	OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.
3	#	Because you have an attitude.
3	#	Yeah, like a swoosh.
3	#	(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.
3	#	Hmm... No you don't.
3	#	The mannequin!
3	#	You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!
3	#	No! You take that mannequin down right now, or I'm pressing charges. (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney.
3	#	Uh-huh
3	#	Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?
3	#	Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin)
3	#	Just get the car!
3	#	Where are you going?
3	#	You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from a friend of mine in Chicago who was shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming from?
3	#	You should have told that story about Packyderm dropping the pizza.
3	#	Do I know him?
3	#	If you were a woman would you go out with him?
3	#	(laughs) Ya, I bet you would. Alright, give him my number.
3	#	Why?
3	#	Is she?
3	#	So?
3	#	Maybe he likes her.
3	#	So now you're going to keep going out with her, for spite?
3	#	(Phil cracking up) So then Packyderm picks up the pieces of pizza, and mind you know they are burning hot.. he can bearly hold 'em. I mean he's like trying to juggle (does a juggling motion and begins laughing) the pizza, you know ah. And then they go flying out of...
3	#	(cont.) they go flying out of his hands, and one lands on her face and the other lands on his face. (pause as they both continue to laugh really hard) and the whole place went crazy.
3	#	I know, I know, I was unbelievable
3	#	(wipes her eyes because she laughed so hard she cried) I know.
3	#	Oh, I'm sorry Jerry didn't suggest this sooner.
3	#	Oh, well, (pauses) Good night.
3	#	Well (leans in to kiss Phil, then looks down at his pants with a awkward look on her face)
3	#	Hello.
3	#	What?
3	#	Oh, the date. The date.
3	#	Interesting.
3	#	Oh ya.
3	#	Let's see, (thinking) how shall I put this.
3	#	He took it out.
3	#	He took (blows on her glasses twice to clean them) it out.
3	#	It.
3	#	Yessiree Bob.
3	#	He did.
3	#	Noooo.
3	#	Yes.
3	#	Oh quite.
3	#	(looks straight into his eyes) Jerry.
3	#	Yea.
3	#	It.
3	#	Out.
3	#	Oh it be. (sarcastically) You got any other friends you want to set me up with?
3	#	(to Kramer) He took it out.
3	#	Oh, hi Greg.
3	#	Yeah. Well, actuall today was the first day I worked out since the Central Park Mini-Marathon.
3	#	No, but I exercised that day. (Laughs.)
3	#	Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?
3	#	Oh.
3	#	No.
3	#	I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.
3	#	Yeah, nice to see you, too.
3	#	(on buzzer) Meh.
3	#	Let's make it fifty.
3	#	Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.
3	#	So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.
3	#	Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.
3	#	Yeah. Definite moisture.
3	#	Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?
3	#	Hey, what happened to you?
3	#	Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.
3	#	Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.
3	#	I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?
3	#	Yeah? What was it?
3	#	You went...in the shower?
3	#	Did you ever hear of...holding it in?
3	#	How do you know?
3	#	I can find out.
3	#	Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.
3	#	Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.
3	#	(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...
3	#	Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.)
3	#	(shocked expression; thinking) Oh my God.
3	#	Oh, it was nothing, for-forget it. (George enters the gym.)
3	#	Yup, you mean him?
3	#	So what do you want me to do?
3	#	How can I do that?
3	#	Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!
3	#	George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.
3	#	I...I don't know...
3	#	No, that's not it!
3	#	Why couldn't you just wait?
3	#	Since when is a drain a toilet?!
3	#	Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em up!
3	#	No, you look pale.
3	#	Hi, Greg.
3	#	Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)
3	#	Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.
3	#	Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.
3	#	Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.
3	#	Yeah! It's a social thing.
3	#	No! I won't be a party to this.
3	#	Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)
3	#	You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?
3	#	Are you sure you want to do that?
3	#	You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.)
3	#	Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)
3	#	You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
3	#	Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?
3	#	Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.
3	#	It's us.
3	#	This is Aaron.
3	#	Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?
3	#	W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.
3	#	(under her breath) Ya that'll happen)
3	#	Bye.
3	#	Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
3	#	What is that?
3	#	Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
3	#	What?
3	#	What?
3	#	Oh.
3	#	(putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.
3	#	Mm hmm.
3	#	Aaron
3	#	Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?
3	#	Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your age?
3	#	You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
3	#	Well first we're going to a matine, I'm taking the afternoon off, we're gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they we are gonna go to dinner. He knows all these fantastic places.
3	#	(already out from behind her desk goes to Aaron) Hi
3	#	Oh, Great.
3	#	Mind? Oh o-of course not.
3	#	(somewhat annoyed) I really don't know Mr. Seinfeld
3	#	N-I know they're your parents Jerry an' they're very nice people. But don't you think it's odd, that a thirty-five year old man is going to these lengths to see that someone else's parents are enjoying themselves? I mean don't you find that abnormal?
3	#	I mean they're your parents and you don't do anything. So why is this stranger doing it?
3	#	See, See, I can't even say anything you know because all he's really doing is being nice but but know body is this nice, this is like certifiably nice.
3	#	Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.
3	#	I don't know, I don't know what to do. (sighs) Oh god.... so how was the movie?
3	#	Ya what do you mean from what you saw?
3	#	Yea why not?
3	#	(thinks for a second) You were making, out during Schindler's List?
3	#	During Schindler's List?
3	#	Did anybody see you? Did anyone say anything?
3	#	Oh.
3	#	Good-bye
3	#	Nice to see..
3	#	Bye.
3	#	Aaron? Aaron are you ok?
3	#	You did enough.
3	#	Why?
3	#	Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
3	#	Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.
3	#	(sighs) So how about that Aaron?
3	#	You know what drove me crazy about him? Did you ever notice that he stood too close to you when he talked?
3	#	You know actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...
3	#	Well, I don't know about "gold."
3	#	Baby'? What, are you doing George now?
3	#	Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, Jerry, it just puts too much pressure on me.
3	#	Yeah, who's he?
3	#	Hi.
3	#	Yeah, how about her?
3	#	Yeah, she's a package full of something.
3	#	Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. (imitates Toby) Really, really great!
3	#	What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?
3	#	Fine... (Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.) How are you?
3	#	Nope.
3	#	Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?
3	#	Really!?
3	#	Oh...well...
3	#	No, really.
3	#	I mean, stranger things have happened...
3	#	Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.
3	#	Really.
3	#	I know.
3	#	I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.
3	#	Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to cut. What do we need it for?
3	#	Why don't you just shut the f-
3	#	Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??
3	#	Oh, wonderful!
3	#	Oh, of course! She's deranged.
3	#	We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a weekend in the Hamptons out of it.
3	#	That was two years ago, remember? 'Jeh-Ree, you gotta see the Bay-Bee! You gotta see the Bay-Bee!'
3	#	Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex yet, but they're spending a weekend together?
3	#	When's Rachel comin' out?
3	#	Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting you see her again after that Schindler's List make-out session.
3	#	Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?
3	#	You know why? One word shade.
3	#	I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
3	#	(Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
3	#	What?
3	#	Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
3	#	Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
3	#	What?
3	#	I'm good.
3	#	Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby.
3	#	Ugghh.
3	#	Oh, gorgeous, yes.
3	#	Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese.
3	#	Oh, you have to lie.
3	#	Yes, it's a must lie situation.
3	#	No, I don't think so.
3	#	Hi.
3	#	(Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous.
3	#	Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't wait to have a baby. I'm just dyin' to have a baby.
3	#	Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
3	#	Yeah, see ya.
3	#	Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
3	#	I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then who's not breathtaking?
3	#	Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out.
3	#	I can be very clever.
3	#	Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and sees George) Oh, don't go in, Rachel's getting undressed.
3	#	What do you mean, like laundry?
3	#	It shrinks?
3	#	Why does it shrink?
3	#	I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
3	#	Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun over here. We're-We're not fun for a baby.
3	#	Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in Jane's ear, which prompts Jane to laugh)
3	#	Some night, huh?
3	#	Some dinner, huh?
3	#	Some house, huh?
3	#	Some ugly baby, huh?
3	#	(improvising) I said, uh, some snuggly baby.
3	#	Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.
3	#	George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.
3	#	Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)
3	#	Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back in the same car with you either.
3	#	How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
3	#	There's Rachel.
3	#	Oh, thank you! (They drink) Mmm, Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. I mean, of course I deserve it.
3	#	You really oughtta do something about that cold.
3	#	I don't fool around, (banging on the table) baby!
3	#	They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that big Japanese conglomerate.
3	#	They're signing the papers next week.
3	#	Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.
3	#	Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving in together.
3	#	Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.
3	#	Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.
3	#	Go talk to her.
3	#	Yes.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	(gasp) An accident? What happened?
3	#	Oh. Ok. Thank you.
3	#	Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?
3	#	(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.
3	#	You want one?
3	#	So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
3	#	At the movies.
3	#	Yeah, he did.
3	#	Right after ... that ...
3	#	Well... the counter...was right there, and...
3	#	No, no, it does!
3	#	But...Jake...
3	#	But, Jake, I didn't...
3	#	Yeah, it got pretty nasty.
3	#	It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit and I got in a cab.
3	#	Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.
3	#	What's all this?
3	#	Oh yeah? How'd you do?
3	#	You always break even.
3	#	Do you have twenty bucks?
3	#	Just gimme twenty bucks.
3	#	Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
3	#	You know, things were going so good for me, you know, I got the job promotion, we were talking about moving in together -
3	#	Night.
3	#	(not wanting to believe it) Oh my God.
3	#	Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, I-I've been sub-letting my apartment from her.
3	#	Hi Tina.
3	#	So, I haven't seen you in a while.
3	#	Well, what is it?
3	#	Kicked out?! Why?!
3	#	Yeah? Like what?
3	#	Ah, I didn't know who he was!
3	#	What else?
3	#	What else have you got?
3	#	(on buzzer) It's me.
3	#	Hi.
3	#	How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my apartment!
3	#	I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
3	#	Yeah, the jewel thief.
3	#	I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. (disappointed) I gotta be out by the end of the month.
3	#	Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)
3	#	Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead)
3	#	(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.
3	#	I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!
3	#	Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant Publishing.
3	#	Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's happened? I've become George.
3	#	It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
3	#	Uh huh.
3	#	Oh, you want one?
3	#	I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.)
3	#	Jerry!
3	#	Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!
3	#	Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.
3	#	Yeah, she was an editor.
3	#	Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.)
3	#	Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -
3	#	O.K., fine, I have...no grace.
3	#	Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.
3	#	Yeah, yeah, right.
3	#	Justin Pitt?
3	#	"Mrs. Onassis's"? That's hard to pronounce.
3	#	Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.)
3	#	I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
3	#	Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.
3	#	Grace?
3	#	You think Ihave grace?
3	#	Just some?
3	#	Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.
3	#	I attend to his personal affairs.
3	#	Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.
3	#	Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
3	#	So, what do you think?
3	#	You don't like them?
3	#	What's wrong?
3	#	Too tight?
3	#	Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)
3	#	Sorry. Hello?
3	#	Jerry?
3	#	Really? When?
3	#	One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?
3	#	Yes.
3	#	Well, it's just one more day.
3	#	Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
3	#	I gotta go. (Hangs up.)
3	#	But what??
3	#	But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.)
3	#	What do you want!?
3	#	Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.
3	#	No, I'm sure you do.
3	#	Well, it's for my boss.
3	#	Elaine.
3	#	It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha
3	#	Uh, aw, KL5-239O.
3	#	Okay, (to Jerry) Move along. . .
3	#	I think he's got ideas.
3	#	Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?
3	#	Hey hey
3	#	Hi.
3	#	Oh, mine's "Ike".
3	#	Ah, no.
3	#	No, no. How about if you bring me back something?
3	#	Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?
3	#	They have big salads.
3	#	They have a big salad.
3	#	It's okay, you don't
3	#	Maybe I should just get married.
3	#	I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.
3	#	You can say that again.
3	#	Good for you.
3	#	Right on baby. (???)
3	#	Who Gendason?
3	#	Why is that name familiar?
3	#	Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?
3	#	So what?
3	#	I still don't see what the big deal is.
3	#	I told ya'. He has ideas.
3	#	Or you.
3	#	Hey.
3	#	No problem.
3	#	Thank you, Julie.
3	#	I like Julie. She's very personable.
3	#	That's great George.
3	#	Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha ha Wht?
3	#	Even though what?
3	#	What? What are you trying to say, George?
3	#	You want the money for the big salad, George?
3	#	What is the problem?
3	#	It must be a mistake.
3	#	Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.
3	#	It's possible.
3	#	He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.
3	#	Ugh! You are kidding me.
3	#	I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.
3	#	To please Mr. Pitt.
3	#	Uh, great!
3	#	Hi Julie.
3	#	Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.
3	#	It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil right away.
3	#	No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.
3	#	Really? A fight with the foreman?
3	#	Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.
3	#	Okay.
3	#	Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.
3	#	I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.
3	#	Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought you the big salad. Didn't ya'.
3	#	Uh, uh.
3	#	She was hitting on you? My friend Noreen?
3	#	Are you sure you're not just flattering yourself?
3	#	I cannot believe that she was hitting on you.
3	#	I will. Besides, she's got a boyfriend, Jerry, you know him. Dan. Remember, we went to that party at his house?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Hello, darling.
3	#	Who's Kristin?
3	#	(dialing the phone) You know what I'm doing? I'm calling Noreen.
3	#	You sure you don't mind?
3	#	Hi, it's Elaine. Listen, I was just talking to Jerry.
3	#	Jerry Seinfeld.
3	#	You mean like like?
3	#	Noreen, were you hitting on him?
3	#	Ooh.
3	#	Uh oh.
3	#	Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Pitt. Hello?
3	#	Is this Noreen?
3	#	Well, listen, Jerry mentioned it, and, I don't know--
3	#	Noreen, are you crying?
3	#	Oh, hi Dan.
3	#	Tell Noreen I'll just call her back later.
3	#	No one. I'm sorry Mr. Pitt, that won't happen again.
3	#	Well, it's a long story, okay? But my stupid friend Jerry told my other friend Noreen that she was-- (noticing Mr. Pitt eating the candy bar with knife and fork and becoming distracted) You know, hitting on him and so I called her to see what was, uh, going on and I accidentally got her boyfriend, who is this, you know--
3	#	(entering and sitting down) I should never have made that phone call.
3	#	Yes, she's very upset.
3	#	I don't know, I never asked. She was yelling--
3	#	Jerry, her brother just had a book of political cartoons published.
3	#	So, yeah, that's funny. Hey, you wanna hear something weird? Mr. Pitt eats his Snickers bars with a knife and fork.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	What?
3	#	I'm really sorry, but you can see why I'd make a mistake like that.
3	#	Well, you know, because he's a high talker.
3	#	No. No, no, no, not a loud talker, a high talker.
3	#	You don't think his voice sounds a lot like yours?
3	#	Well, it's no big deal, you know, it's just that he can sound like a woman, you know?
3	#	Well, he looks like a man.
3	#	He's bald. I know that's a guy thing.
3	#	I know he belches a lot.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	What are you doing?
3	#	No, no, no, but why are you using a knife and a fork? Did you just
3	#	And now I think she might really be interested in you. And Dan is
3	#	Nana?
3	#	Missing?
3	#	Um, what does Nana sound like?
3	#	Well...
3	#	I don't know, maybe.
3	#	It's possible.
3	#	Wow. Isn't this little bunny giving you the-
3	#	You should show this to Georgie.
3	#	I just don't get it.
3	#	What is wrong with everybody?
3	#	(standing up) What is wrong with all you people?! Have you all gone mad?!!
3	#	(sarcastic) Don't worry, Jerry, I can manage these bags; really I'm fine.
3	#	Can we rest here a second.
3	#	Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend Paul.
3	#	No, but... he has... The Worst Habit. Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on. Ya have'ta go through, like, ten minutes of chit-chat.
3	#	Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone I just hang up.
3	#	Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?
3	#	That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
3	#	Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
3	#	Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?
3	#	That sounds urgent...
3	#	Donna Chang?
3	#	Isn't that a little racist?
3	#	He's on with a Chinese woman.
3	#	You got a comfort problem there?
3	#	I thought you wore silk underwear.
3	#	(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
3	#	A lot!
3	#	With the Chinese woman?!
3	#	What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
3	#	(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.
3	#	She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?
3	#	I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese...
3	#	(matter of fact) You can't get one ring past him.
3	#	Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
3	#	Well, he was with someone. A man... In a cape.
3	#	Hi Paul! It's Elaine calling! Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone so I don't really have time to talk. Is, is, uh, Noreen there?!... Oh. She's not?! (hurries to put phone down) Okay, great. Well you can just tell her I called, then, an'-- Well, yes. It has been unseasonably cool lately... Oh, okay, well, look I'm pulling up to the building now. So, I'm gonna... (a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)
3	#	She's not Chinese?
3	#	So. What is she?
3	#	(pause, annoyed) Oh, how disappointed you must have been. (walks to couch, with her cereal)
3	#	So then why are you seeing her again...
3	#	Listen, I spoke to Paul an' Noreen. They might be breakin' up.
3	#	Well, maybe.
3	#	(pause) What do you mean?
3	#	Whoa! Whoa!
3	#	Ay, divorced. That's really too bad...
3	#	Hey Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
3	#	What?
3	#	No, Kramer. You don't understand. This could be my fault.
3	#	What? What?...
3	#	(backing away from Kramer) Eeaawww...
3	#	So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...
3	#	Oh, he went insane?...
3	#	(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!
3	#	(looks at Noreen) I'm really sorry, Noreen...
3	#	Hey, Noreen, don't go by me! Ha ha.
3	#	(head in arms) I know--
3	#	Well... I got confused, they sound exactly the same.
3	#	(apologetically) I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
3	#	Well, I guess I just didn't realize it...
3	#	(like a little girl) Okay...
3	#	She was lost...
3	#	Well, she didn't seem to be havin' so much fun...
3	#	If I have this much influence over her, why don't I just call her an' tell her to get back together with him--that's aalll!
3	#	(happy gasp) Oh.
3	#	(off camera) Huh.
3	#	Paul?
3	#	Kramer?
3	#	What are you doin' there?
3	#	(scoffs) Uh, is Noreen there?
3	#	(pause) Well... Can I talk to her?
3	#	(losing patience) Alright--would you just put her on?
3	#	YOU feel?
3	#	What, are you insane?!
3	#	Uh! Ho-ho. An' what are YOU gonna tell her?
3	#	(sighs) Kramer! You have GOT to let me talk to her!
3	#	Get the-- (Kramer puts phone down)
3	#	So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!
3	#	(pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
3	#	(quietly) hu_uh, (pause) You know, everybody listens to the Chinese. I mean, look at the fortune cookie. You couldn't get away with that in any other restaurant.
3	#	Hey, what's going on?
3	#	New couch? Why?
3	#	Oh, let me get the door for you. (They carry the couch out the door.) Ooh, be careful!
3	#	What are you doing with your old couch?
3	#	Yeah, I'll take it.
3	#	Yes, they can. (Kramer enters.)
3	#	What was that again?
3	#	I heard Poppie's was good, let's go.
3	#	Ooh! I love duck. C'mon, c'mon!
3	#	Well, I don't know. I'll have to sit on it.
3	#	Kay. You, uh...you got room in the truck for me?
3	#	Oh, goody. Okay, well uh...(to Jerry and Kramer)...I'll see you chumps later. (Elaine and Carl exit.)
3	#	So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, "Do you date moving men?"
3	#	You wanna know what I said?
3	#	"I do now."
3	#	Is that something?
3	#	Is that something?
3	#	Well, they're real men, Jerry. They get sweaty.
3	#	Yes.
3	#	Nice to meet you, Poppie.
3	#	Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
3	#	Boy, I'm really looking forward to this duck. I've never had food ordered in advance before.
3	#	Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.
3	#	Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.
3	#	No way.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.
3	#	Yeah. That's right.
3	#	Nothing.
3	#	What's wrong with him?
3	#	Yeah. You're right.
3	#	Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?
3	#	You don't have any furniture?
3	#	Well, I can understand that. Pretty good date, huh?
3	#	I'm in looove!
3	#	This is it, Jerry! This is it! He is such an incredible person! He's real, he's honest, he's unpretentious...oh, I'm really lucky!
3	#	No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)
3	#	Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.
3	#	Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.
3	#	Hi. (They kiss.)
3	#	Oh, I missed you!
3	#	Me, either!
3	#	You do?
3	#	Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.
3	#	Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)
3	#	Oh my god.
3	#	So, you're gonna get a new couch?
3	#	Do you want your old couch back?
3	#	Who's that?
3	#	No, no, he's not my boyfriend.
3	#	Take a guess.
3	#	Hi.
3	#	Did you tell him it was peed on?
3	#	Yeah, me too.
3	#	Yeah. It is.
3	#	Can I offer you anything to drink?
3	#	What meeting?
3	#	Oh! (tries to take paper)
3	#	Yes?
3	#	All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.
3	#	Come in, come in!
3	#	Ah, right there, yeah.
3	#	Kramer, it's...
3	#	Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work to do, okay?
3	#	Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.
3	#	Kramer, what's wrong?
3	#	Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?
3	#	(pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is so cool!
3	#	(pointing) Right here.
3	#	No, no, unfocus.
3	#	(answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.
3	#	Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?
3	#	How can I go?
3	#	Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.
3	#	Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)
3	#	All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the new company gonna be?
3	#	(making a face) "Moland"?
3	#	Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything called "Moland".
3	#	Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?
3	#	Well, what did you think she was gonna do?
3	#	No, what?
3	#	What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk and...
3	#	Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?
3	#	The balance beam?
3	#	(gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
3	#	I dunno, at least three weeks.
3	#	Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly put the kibosh on the big water merger.
3	#	Yeah. Started a big name controversy.
3	#	Well, I couldn't help it. "Moland Spring"?
3	#	Well, I'm so sorry! I-
3	#	Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello?
3	#	(on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!
3	#	Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!
3	#	(on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at that poster!
3	#	(grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!
3	#	In about twenty minutes.
3	#	Um, no.
3	#	Uh, Mr. Pitt...
3	#	Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)
3	#	No?
3	#	Heyyyyyy (leaning in, very friendly and happy)
3	#	I went to England ... with Mr. Pitt, for 5 days.
3	#	Actually it was great. I met an Englishman, and we really, hit it off.
3	#	Yeah well Jerome, I, happen to be flying him in on my frequent flyer miles.
3	#	It's an open ended ticket. He can return any time he wants.
3	#	Hi. (she flips her hair)
3	#	O.K. Thanks.
3	#	An Armani suit?
3	#	So the trip was good?
3	#	You know I, I have to say, I've never admitted this to anyone, but um, I kind of like airline food. (leans in and laughs, flirting with him)
3	#	What?
3	#	Yeah, what?
3	#	What?
3	#	Huh. (muttering) This should be interesting.
3	#	Nothing.
3	#	What kind of soup did he get?
3	#	Consomm, hmm.
3	#	Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.
3	#	What?
3	#	Was it a cup or a bowl?
3	#	Im just curious.
3	#	Did he crumble any crackers in it?
3	#	(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?
3	#	Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.
3	#	Oh, hi Simon. This is Jerry.
3	#	Um, yeah in my purse.
3	#	Where you going?
3	#	Oh, OK, see you later.
3	#	(English accent) Pardon?
3	#	Hi.
3	#	Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)
3	#	About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)
3	#	Thanks
3	#	Hey, What are you doing out here?
3	#	Reggies? I can't eat anything there.
3	#	There's no Big Salad.
3	#	All right. Let's go, to Reggies.
3	#	Ahh ... wait till you hear this.
3	#	So Simon picks this woman up, right in front of me.
3	#	How bout a Big Salad?
3	#	(to George) Ya see?
3	#	It's a salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it.
3	#	Could you put it in a big bowl?
3	#	All right. Just give me a cup of decaf.
3	#	So, Simon is definitely going back now. He's meeting me here to return my keys.
3	#	Yes. He's one of those bounders.
3	#	AHhh. Thank you.
3	#	Ah (hu ha - small laugh)
3	#	When are you leaving?
3	#	(turns towards the lunch counter) Hey Kenny. You still want to get that suit back?
3	#	There it goes. (pointing at Simon walking out the door)
3	#	Was that Tim Whatley?
3	#	I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.)
3	#	Why?
3	#	Ohhh!
3	#	A LeBaron?
3	#	Jon Voight? The actor?
3	#	I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)
3	#	I like coffee.
3	#	Yes, Mr. Pitt?
3	#	No, I'm still working on it.
3	#	Artie Shaw. "Honeysuckle Jump." (The song ends.)
3	#	Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.
3	#	Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?
3	#	Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)
3	#	Will you shut up? I can't hear!
3	#	Oh! I've got it! It's "Next Stop Pottersville"! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)
3	#	So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.
3	#	Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...
3	#	And I asked him, "Should Jerry bring anything?"
3	#	Mmmm...and he said, "Why would Jerry bring anything?"
3	#	What?
3	#	I think he emphasized "would."
3	#	Alright, that's enough of this.
3	#	I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.
3	#	He finds his laugh "intoxicating." (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)
3	#	Um, it was, uh..."Next Stop Pottersville." (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?
3	#	What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?
3	#	What? I can't hear you.
3	#	I told you, I can't hear a word.
3	#	Tim.
3	#	What?
3	#	Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.
3	#	OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.
3	#	Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.
3	#	All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes)
3	#	Hey George
3	#	All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.
3	#	I said, All Right.
3	#	Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the "i" sounds like an "e") Moore in Indecent Proposal.
3	#	Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)
3	#	Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.
3	#	Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?
3	#	Oh Im returning this dress to Barneys.
3	#	Yeah yeah, ok.
3	#	Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.
3	#	yeah.
3	#	Well we could ...
3	#	I cant believe they made the Wife the killer. (putting on gloves) Gimme a break.
3	#	How'd you manage that.
3	#	Where?
3	#	What would he be doing wearing your jacket?
3	#	Are you sure?
3	#	You are amazing.
3	#	These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.
3	#	OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator)
3	#	Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?
3	#	I like your little bag.
3	#	Huh.
3	#	Kramer, what are you doing here?
3	#	What?
3	#	So go buy a new one.
3	#	So.
3	#	Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door)
3	#	Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?
3	#	I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.
3	#	Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)
3	#	Hey, what do you think of this?
3	#	This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.
3	#	No?
3	#	I am?
3	#	Ha! That's preposterous.
3	#	No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?
3	#	Jerry?
3	#	Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?
3	#	(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of
3	#	No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?
3	#	I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
3	#	What list?
3	#	MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.
3	#	Ned must have left it here.
3	#	HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.
3	#	Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told me?
3	#	Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.
3	#	Where's Lois?
3	#	Who's he?
3	#	Uh uh
3	#	What's that?
3	#	Oh, of course.
3	#	No.

3	#	Well what happened when you raced him again?
3	#	So now Duncan is back?
3	#	So how was work? Another day, another dollar?
3	#	Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . . . are you a communist?

3	#	Well, I'm dating a communist.
3	#	Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?
3	#	Oh, congratulations

3	#	Um. Kramer!
3	#	Hi, oh hi Mickey, this is Ned
3	#	You guys stay here, I'll be right back.
3	#	. . . shut up! (?)
3	#	Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful Communist?
3	#	I'm going to order Chinese Food.
3	#	Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with him.
3	#	You're father was blacklisted?
3	#	Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.

3	#	Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff.
3	#	How do you feel?
3	#	No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis recquet.
3	#	He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to pick that up

3	#	Uh, no. Not really.
3	#	Newman plays tennis?
3	#	Uh, no ... take it.
3	#	Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.
3	#	Thanks
3	#	What could I do? She said there might be something for me at Doubleday. Oh wouldn't that be great I wouldn't have to work for Mr. Pitt anymore.
3	#	Bye
3	#	Have you noticed she never laughs
3	#	Yeah
3	#	See, what did I tell ya?
3	#	Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when I can pick up Mr. Pitt's racquet.
3	#	(on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please. Wa? Oh, Gosh, ah ok, she'll be in later? OK, thank you. Uh. (to Jerry) This guy said she hurt her arm playing tennis. ... Pretty bad.

3	#	Oh
3	#	Oh, you'll be playing ...
3	#	There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and uh uh mah jong,

3	#	... hiking ...
3	#	(sees racquet) Could I ...
3	#	(sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna, ok, well, you know. Take care of that condolitis
3	#	I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she might never play tennis again
3	#	augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy
3	#	He'll only play with his racquet
3	#	That's stealing?
3	#	I know.
3	#	JERRY Hey
3	#	Ah, I'm ready what?
3	#	You found out Kramer's first name?
3	#	JERRY Cosmo?
3	#	JERRY Cosmo
3	#	Cosmo, Cosmo?
3	#	COSMO?
3	#	It's not such a bad name.
3	#	Uh, no, I'm OK.
3	#	Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.
3	#	No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.
3	#	All right. I'm going I'm going
3	#	Give it give it ..
3	#	All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention any of this to Miss. Landis do you?
3	#	No, I got caught.
3	#	Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going to get a job. He's going to tell Landis that I was sneakin around her office.
3	#	Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy this afternoon.
3	#	Hi Cosmo
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Hey. Oh, is that a label maker?
3	#	Love the Label Baby, baby. You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.
3	#	Yeah. Who sent you that one?
3	#	Not, my Tim Whatley?
3	#	I think this is the same one I gave him. He recycled this gift. He's a regifter!
3	#	Yeah, perhaps.
3	#	Um, he said, "Oh. A label maker. Howbout that?"
3	#	Yeah, so?
3	#	What do you mean?
3	#	I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.
3	#	Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.
3	#	Yes it is.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?
3	#	I would love to go upstairs.
3	#	We'll see.
3	#	Hey, guess what? I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.
3	#	We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.
3	#	Ah, well.
3	#	It was totally out of the blue. We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.
3	#	No.
3	#	I said, "Do you wanna go upstairs?"
3	#	What?
3	#	Why?
3	#	You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?
3	#	You're crazy.
3	#	As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave. I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.
3	#	I've got a confession to make.
3	#	I've got Super Bowl fever.
3	#	So where are we staying?
3	#	Oh. Big room?
3	#	Downtown?
3	#	What do they have there, a couple of beds?
3	#	No, but don't you think there should be two beds? There's two of us.
3	#	Hello, Tim.
3	#	Don't worry, Tim. I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all. I just came by to pick up my label maker. I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.
3	#	But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl. Hand it over, Whatley.
3	#	You don't have the label maker, do you?
3	#	I knew it! You're a regifter!
3	#	What?
3	#	(visibly upset) Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work. The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.
3	#	Were you just talking about me?
3	#	Oh, the guy with cancer?
3	#	Egh, Jake Jarmel?
3	#	Why? You don't wear glasses.
3	#	Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.
3	#	You know, we had a really bad break-up.
3	#	(upset) Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.
3	#	So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?
3	#	Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.
3	#	What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?
3	#	I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?
3	#	No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.
3	#	Nowhere.
3	#	So what if I do? (heads for the door)
3	#	So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.
3	#	That's what I'm saying.
3	#	Correct.
3	#	Correct.
3	#	Correct. (catches herself) What's that?
3	#	(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?
3	#	Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh...
3	#	Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?
3	#	(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.
3	#	(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?
3	#	Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?
3	#	Malaysia?
3	#	Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?
3	#	(positive) Oh! (little chuckle)
3	#	C'mon.
3	#	Let's start the bidding.
3	#	Jake, Jake. Take a look. (puts on the frames she bought) Aaw, see, you're not the only one who has 'em. I have them too.
3	#	Malaysia. I was in the area.
3	#	Oh, Mr Lippman. (joins laughter) That is so exciting. I mean, you have no idea how sick I am of running around town looking for socks.
3	#	Oh really, you like 'em?
3	#	Well, you know what? (removes glasses)
3	#	(hands them over) You can have 'em.
3	#	No no no no. Go to that place on the corner, they'll change the prescription in an hour. Take 'em.
3	#	Yeah, I've no use for them anymore. Honestly.
3	#	They're from Malaysia.
3	#	(admiring gasp) Fabulous.
3	#	(mouths) 'Scuse me. Have to go (audible) look for some socks.
3	#	I know. I need a lesson.
3	#	Oh. My ballet tickets.
3	#	Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?
3	#	You know, I'm going as a beard.
3	#	Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.
3	#	So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.
3	#	Swan Lake, at the Met.
3	#	Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?
3	#	Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
3	#	Oh, come on.
3	#	You look ridiculous in that thing.
3	#	Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.
3	#	Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.
3	#	Yes indeed.
3	#	Really. Why?
3	#	Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.
3	#	Oh, hi honey.
3	#	Oh it was such a great night.
3	#	No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.
3	#	Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
3	#	Oh I did?
3	#	Oh.
3	#	He's incredible.
3	#	Yeah, I know.
3	#	What?
3	#	Well it did occur to me.
3	#	Why? Is it irrevocable?
3	#	We've got a good team.
3	#	Why can't he play for us?
3	#	We just got along *so* great.
3	#	No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.
3	#	I realize that.
3	#	Yes I am.
3	#	Melrose Place?
3	#	I just didn't know you watched that.
3	#	I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.
3	#	You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...
3	#	Why? Why were you so embarrassed?
3	#	That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
3	#	So what are you going to do?
3	#	Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?
3	#	Oh god this tastes terrible.
3	#	No.
3	#	No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
3	#	So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.
3	#	Yeah, I think I might.
3	#	What do you mean bald?
3	#	Oh come on.
3	#	Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
3	#	Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.
3	#	Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.
3	#	(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
3	#	(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.
3	#	Well I figured that's what couples do.
3	#	Well it was easy. Really.
3	#	Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?
3	#	Yeah. Upstairs?
3	#	I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?
3	#	Have you ever thought about it?
3	#	Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.
3	#	Hey, I did it.
3	#	I turned him. He defected.
3	#	Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.
3	#	Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.
3	#	He went back.
3	#	Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.
3	#	Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.
3	#	Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?
3	#	Okay.
3	#	Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.
3	#	What is the matter?
3	#	I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.
3	#	(from a distance) Hey.
3	#	(to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy.
3	#	(warning) George.
3	#	Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.
3	#	(slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
3	#	(pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.
3	#	She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.
3	#	Because, it is what she does.
3	#	George, you got a little something, right here.
3	#	Why?
3	#	Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.
3	#	Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.
3	#	Yeah. Hah.
3	#	No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.
3	#	(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's right. I'll bring her over to meet...
3	#	(to Kramer) ...Kramer.
3	#	(to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just fine.
3	#	Wha... W.. Are you going home?
3	#	Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?
3	#	No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
3	#	Yeah, she'll be here any second.
3	#	Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.
3	#	Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?
3	#	What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?
3	#	How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
3	#	(indicating) That's her. That's her.
3	#	Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.
3	#	Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.
3	#	(hopeful) Oh, you were?
3	#	Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...
3	#	Oh, Kramer.
3	#	You wanna go out with him?
3	#	Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...
3	#	I'm just thinking about the question.
3	#	Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.
3	#	(laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...
3	#	Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud)
3	#	Why?
3	#	Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.
3	#	Ugh, the hell with 'em.
3	#	What're you stopping here for?
3	#	(pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.
3	#	Yeah, but it's only three blocks.
3	#	(unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well...
3	#	She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?
3	#	I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says "Well, this is as far as I can take you."
3	#	I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.
3	#	Yeah, alright, I gotta go.
3	#	(surprised) George!
3	#	(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?
3	#	(shocked) Insurance? You're charging me?
3	#	Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.
3	#	(pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about that hair.
3	#	Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to receptionist) Uh, tell her.
3	#	Where've you been? We're gonna miss the movie, let's go.
3	#	What guy?
3	#	Six. But then the night doorman comes on. He's much scarier. (scary noise) Whugh! (laughs) Ha-ha.
3	#	(unhappy) I...
3	#	(accepting) Okay, okay.
3	#	Jerry, it's six. (claps her hands) Let's go.
3	#	No, don't...
3	#	(quietly) Give that to me.
3	#	(taking the phone) Hello Mr. Pitt. How's Scotland?
3	#	A party. Oh no, that was just my stupid friend Jerry.
3	#	Believe me, we're not entertained. We were just leaving. (to Jerry) Oh, can you grab those empty bottles for me.
3	#	Oh, well, Mr. Pitt, there's really nothing that can't wait. We're trying to catch a movie.
3	#	Alright. (to Jerry, upset) I can't go.
3	#	...Uhm, the new Time magazine. The new People...
3	#	(to Jerry) What? What'd you say to the doorman?
3	#	(sitting beside Jerry) He claims that you followed him home, and started harassing him.
3	#	Hey, did you make the movie?
3	#	You wanna go tonight? You can pick me up.
3	#	Ugh. So now we have to rearrange our lives to avoid the doorman?
3	#	What is wrong with George?
3	#	I can't believe you left your post.
3	#	(to one of the tenants) Hey, what's up? What's going on here?
3	#	(quietly to Jerry) Jerry, let's get out of here.
3	#	What were you doing watching the door anyway?
3	#	(thinking) You know, my fingerprints are all over this. That doorman knows you're a friend of mine. He'll tell that co-op lady, she'll tell Mr. Pitt... Jerry, I'm in this too deep.
3	#	(taking command) Alright, shut up. Shut up. Just let me think. I gotta think. We gotta get our story straight.
3	#	Alright, (claps hands) here it is. This is what we'll tell 'em. You came to pick me up...
3	#	Yeah. That's what I just said.
3	#	Yeah, I know what you were just. It's not helping.
3	#	Okay, you came to pick me up at...
3	#	You see? Again.
3	#	Alright, you came right upstairs, without talking to the doorman.
3	#	(intense) So what? No-one's gonna believe a doorman!
3	#	(aggressive, with finger pointing) Just stick with the story. We'll be fine. Let me do the talking!
3	#	Good. Now fix me a drink.
3	#	Oh really? (skeptical) The doorman. And, pray tell, what did the doorman say?
3	#	(dismissive) Oh, my. Well, the doorman certainly has a wild imagination, doesn't he?
3	#	(in a rush) He never watched a door before, Mrs Payton, he didn't know how to do it. (pleading) You know, he's a comedian, Mrs Payton, they don't know how to do anything.
3	#	(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.
3	#	(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.
3	#	Is it possible we were victims of a sting?
3	#	Anyway, Jerry... Jerry?
3	#	We have to replace the couch.
3	#	But it's got a pee-stain on it.
3	#	(not sure) I guess.
3	#	It's a beautiful couch.
3	#	Wha...?
3	#	"Oh! Okay. Right. Thanks Mr Pitt....'kay. ..goodbye."
3	#	(to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet Fog".
3	#	"Yeah! Mel Torm, That's his nickname."
3	#	"Do you wanna go or not?"
3	#	"He's performing at this AMCA benefit."
3	#	"Able Mentally Challenged Adults"
3	#	"What are you..crazy?"
3	#	"Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you know that ..hemmm! blond guy who's always at the exercycle at the health club?"
3	#	"Yeah yeah! He's really handsome with those..."
3	#	"You can't find beauty in a man?"
3	#	"He's smart...."
3	#	"Penthouse?"
3	#	"Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that ..that blond guy who's always on the exercycle at the health club. You know he's just really handsome?.."
3	#	"You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't necessarily make you a homosexual."
3	#	"All right, I'm gone"
3	#	(We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come on. I'm stretching right in front of you. Heeeey!! ...a smile. Aah! we made contact, all right one more stretch and then go talk to him.
3	#	"Aaaaaahhh! He is?!"
3	#	"AAaaaaahhh! Really?"(giggles)
3	#	"Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."
3	#	"Ha...."
3	#	(as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"
3	#	"I'm going to that!"
3	#	"What are you talking about?"
3	#	"Yeah, yeah! Arnold DEENSFREI, he runs the AMCA "
3	#	"I know that but why are you going?"
3	#	"What you do!!. You don't do anything."
3	#	(pointing at the shoes) "What are those?"
3	#	"He thinks you're mentally challenged."
3	#	"Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that you're not.?"
3	#	"....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you were hallucinating you're coming out of the gas but you were still under the gas."
3	#	"your shirt was out?"
3	#	"Well, what kind of shirt was it.?"
3	#	"Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"
3	#	"Well. Were you tucked?"
3	#	"All right then say you were. I mean .. what do you think could have happened.?"
3	#	"Ughhhh"
3	#	"What are you gettin'?"
3	#	"Okay...So you were violated by two people while you were under the gas. So What? You're single."
3	#	"Join the club."
3	#	"Oh yeah! Jimmy."
3	#	"Ahum!"
3	#	"Yeah!"
3	#	"Why?"
3	#	"How so?"
3	#	"No No... That's not him. That's the guy who gave me... Jimmy's number."
3	#	"I'm going to go see Mel Torm with him?"
3	#	"Yes you did you said George likes spicy chicken..
3	#	"Well.... (pointing at him) Jimmy!"
3	#	"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."
3	#	"Yeah. What happened was...."
3	#	(suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone talk the way you do. It's very unusual."
3	#	"Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought that Jimmy......"
3	#	"Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not going through that again."
3	#	"Yeah!"
3	#	"I don't care"
3	#	"Hey Jimmy!!"
3	#	"Elaine got a new dress."
3	#	What is with him?
3	#	So, you know what? My friend Judy recommended me for a job at Viking Press.
3	#	Yeah! But get this. Viking has a deal with the Plaza Hotel, they got a two bedroom suite, there, for out-of-town clients...So guess what I did?
3	#	I know, I know Jerry.. but it's The Plazaaa... I've never stayed there .It'll be like a little vacation

3	#	Yeah.
3	#	She...likes you..
3	#	Ya!
3	#	Yep!

3	#	No I'll take my chances. Come on...( Grabs him by the coat and head back to his place)
3	#	Jerry , I need that Fedex right now..
3	#	Well, I didn't know that it was a manuscript that I had to read...
3	#	My manuscript?
3	#	Kramer You got go back in there grab my manuscript.

3	#	Okay... bathroom....kitchen.
3	#	(again pants) I couldn't find it anywhere. How did you get fleas anyway?
3	#	I 've looked everywhere , even under the couch but all I could find were the stupid Chunky wrappers. I couldn't....
3	#	Yeah!
3	#	Did you read the whole thing?
3	#	Huh . So What's it about?
3	#	unbridled enthusiasm...?
3	#	Oh! boy.
3	#	Oh! my God.
3	#	(to the waitress) can I have a scotch on the rocks.
3	#	(feeling sick) Yeah! go ahead.
3	#	What? What are you doin'? ( Kramer salting her food)
3	#	What are you talking about?
3	#	It's a story about love , deception ,greed , lust and.... unbridled enthusiasm .
3	#	Yeah!..tha..that's right. that That's what led to...(throath clearing) Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
3	#	Yes...Ye..Yes..That's right...You see ,Billy Mumphrey was a simple country boy. Some might say a cockeyed optimist, who got caught up in the dirty game of world diplomacy and International intrigue.
3	#	Yes, yes Mr. Mandel.
3	#	Mr Mandel, you don't understand ...my my friend had fleas. I ran into the gas, it could have killed me, and my, my other friend couldn't taste his peaches ,they only good for two weeks.
3	#	Okay...Good day..
3	#	( knocks) Hello is anybody here?..
3	#	Oh! my God.
3	#	Yeah. What, is it a problem?
3	#	Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.
3	#	Oh, god.
3	#	Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.
3	#	Fine.
3	#	No.
3	#	No, nothing.
3	#	I was with David *Putty* last night.
3	#	He did the move.
3	#	You know...*the* move.
3	#	Yes, yes.
3	#	Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.
3	#	What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!
3	#	Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
3	#	Well, wait---wait a second.
3	#	Isn't that a little...rash?
3	#	Yeah, but...*I* like the move.
3	#	Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!
3	#	You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.
3	#	Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!
3	#	What?!!
3	#	What?
3	#	Oh, oh, come on, please?
3	#	Oh, so---so that's it?
3	#	Yeah, yeah, hello.
3	#	Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.
3	#	Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.
3	#	Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.
3	#	I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!
3	#	Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.
3	#	I'm not surprised.
3	#	Why?
3	#	An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
3	#	(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?
3	#	Fusilli Jerry?
3	#	Hi.
3	#	Hey, let me ask you a question.
3	#	What do you charge for blown shocks?
3	#	Two, three hundred?
3	#	Ah.
3	#	What about a bad gasket?
3	#	Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
3	#	Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.
3	#	Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.
3	#	Oh.
3	#	Is that with the parts and labor?
3	#	Hmm.
3	#	Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....
3	#	So what are you going to do?
3	#	Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?
3	#	Me either.
3	#	Is that the supermodel?
3	#	I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
3	#	Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and I am telling him that I am quitting.
3	#	I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
3	#	I'm marchin'. (Enter George)
3	#	I'm marchin' in.
3	#	This is it. Wish me luck.
3	#	Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.
3	#	Mr. Pitt...
3	#	What?
3	#	(Flattered) Mr. Pitt...
3	#	Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,
3	#	We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want you to live a long, long time.
3	#	Oh my God.
3	#	Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... shopping. How did this happen?
3	#	Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.
3	#	I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
3	#	Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?
3	#	You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
3	#	Hello?
3	#	That's at the airport, right?
3	#	All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.
3	#	Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious of Elaine)
3	#	I said I'll take care of it!
3	#	Kramer.
3	#	Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here about his plane in Ithaca?
3	#	Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?
3	#	Uh huh.
3	#	Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!
3	#	Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
3	#	(to the busboy) Oh, thanks very much, the soup was really good.
3	#	What?
3	#	Yeah, why? Wouldn't he want the soup to be good?
3	#	Hey, isn't that Alec Berg?
3	#	I can't stand him, he is so pretentious.
3	#	No, Alec Berg.
3	#	Hi!
3	#	Thank you very much.
3	#	Who?
3	#	I will never understand people.
3	#	What's it?
3	#	Siena?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Softer.
3	#	Sheets.
3	#	Colors.
3	#	What, you never said it?
3	#	Oh hey, can I bring David Puddy? He's a big Devils' fan.
3	#	So how long have you been a Devils' fan?
3	#	Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick your butts tonight.
3	#	Yes.
3	#	Alright, you almost ready? Cause Jerry and Kramer are gonna be here any second.
3	#	What the--
3	#	What is that?
3	#	(still in disbelief) You painted your face?
3	#	Why?
3	#	Well, you can't walk around like that.
3	#	Because it's insane?
3	#	Dave, um, painted his face.
3	#	Will you sit down? You're disturbing everybody. Sit down!
3	#	That poor priest. He was just visiting from El Salvador. Now he's gone completely loco.
3	#	Yeah. He thinks he saw the devil. He won't leave his room in the church basement.
3	#	I mean, what compels a seemingly normal human being to do something like that?
3	#	You know I really hate my clothes.
3	#	I open up my closet, there's just nothing.
3	#	Nothing. I hate everything I have, I really hate it. (The weeping increases in volume and intensity) I mean, at this point, it's like I can wear something three or four times and that's it.
3	#	It's getting to be a terrible problem for me.
3	#	No, it's from the store.
3	#	David? David, I think we aught to talk.
3	#	David, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
3	#	Well, you see, David, you're a face painter.
3	#	Well, it's not that I don't like you, but, well to be perfectly honest, I'm just having some trouble getting past the face painting.
3	#	Yeah, but you like the face painting.
3	#	Oh. You mean you'd stop it for me?
3	#	That's so, that's so sweet.
3	#	What is that?
3	#	Why is the letter 'D' painted on your chest?
3	#	But you said no more painting.
3	#	Yeah, that's right.
3	#	Hello father.
3	#	I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus
3	#	How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things to do.
3	#	What?, uh?
3	#	What is so funny?
3	#	The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling me a dog.
3	#	Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge
3	#	Because they're the best Jerry, the best. Look. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.
3	#	Yeah, who speaks Korean?
3	#	No, who?
3	#	You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
3	#	What did he do?
3	#	Uh,
3	#	Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?
3	#	uh, ha.
3	#	Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure if you want.
3	#	Uh, Mr. Costanza, I
3	#	Mr. Costanza, I,
3	#	Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank.
3	#	What'd they say? What'd they say?
3	#	(sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even know where I'm going.
3	#	yes, (sob) I suppose,
3	#	Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,
3	#	Uh, (sob) thanks.
3	#	How do you know all that?
3	#	You mean..?
3	#	Oh!
3	#	Oh, that's not too expensive.
3	#	Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and mayhem at once.
3	#	Hello
3	#	You're welcome.
3	#	Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets to the show.
3	#	Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job.
3	#	Writing for the J. Peterman catalogue.
3	#	I met him.
3	#	yeah.
3	#	He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for running along side a train, (Jerry walking away) waving last goodbyes, posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ...
3	#	. . . Small, Medium, Large, XL, Double...
3	#	Oh, she got hurt.
3	#	I, uh, wait,
3	#	Shut up! Shut up! You stupid mutt.
3	#	Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep because of that dog.
3	#	This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that never never stops barking..
3	#	I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? What am I gonna do?
3	#	What? KRAMER, I'll do anything.
3	#	Uh-huh.
3	#	I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything.
3	#	Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time.
3	#	Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it.
3	#	Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?
3	#	No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
3	#	I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. I'll let you know.
3	#	All right. Let's do it.
3	#	That's it. That's it. Stop right here.
3	#	What? What do you need a rope for?
3	#	I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this.
3	#	KRAMER, are we doing a bad thing?
3	#	Yeah. That's him.
3	#	What time you got?
3	#	What do you do?
3	#	How close do you get?
3	#	Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have to look at the sun.
3	#	Well, what about at night? What do you do then?
3	#	Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
3	#	But he's so small.
3	#	That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
3	#	How could that be the dog?
3	#	Yeah. Yeah. I'll know if he barks.
3	#	Bark.
3	#	You think we're far enough.
3	#	No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.
3	#	I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's no way.
3	#	I know.
3	#	Oh, I can't Jerry. 4I'm sworn to secrecy.
3	#	News? What news?
3	#	What? What?
3	#	Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please, please, please, please!
3	#	Yeah?
3	#	Get out!
3	#	I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What kind of life is this?
3	#	Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved.
3	#	Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very nice man.
3	#	Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on.
3	#	I know.
3	#	He's in.
3	#	What's to discuss?
3	#	Is he happy?
3	#	Well, that's all that counts, I guess.
3	#	Oh, nothin'.
3	#	Well, what do you want me to do?
3	#	Well, I don't.
3	#	Oh, what? You think I wanna marry George?
3	#	Oh, please! That is the last thing that I want.
3	#	Yeah, right.
3	#	Jerry!
3	#	Yeah, that's right. I don't wanna get married.
3	#	Oh, you come on.
3	#	Oh, dear.
3	#	Well, I could care less. I hope it is on our record. I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
3	#	Oh, hello, Rabbi Krischma.
3	#	Thanks again for taking care of that dog for us.
3	#	Yeah, I suppose.
3	#	No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.
3	#	I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need of some guidance here.
3	#	Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, George, got engaged .
3	#	Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment.
3	#	No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole think makes me . . sick.
3	#	Yeah, I don't know what that means.
3	#	You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm smart. I'm attractive.
3	#	No, no, it's okay.
3	#	I don't think so.
3	#	I've got that magazine article for you.
3	#	Are you
3	#	Yeah, talked earlier.
3	#	. . . What does that mean?
3	#	He didn't mention . . .
3	#	He told you about our conversation?
3	#	He told you about . . .
3	#	He told you all that? How could he?
3	#	Can he do that?
3	#	But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth?
3	#	Yeah
3	#	No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about?
3	#	Of course it was a problem for me. . . . You didn't, you didn't tell anyone else about this, did you?
3	#	Mrs. Winston?
3	#	What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did you?
3	#	You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth floor.
3	#	my god, you didn't.
3	#	But the whole thing is a mess. He told everyone in the building. I met that cute guy on the fifth floor. I mean he could barely bring himself to nod.
3	#	You didn't say this to George, did you?
3	#	Yeah that! So, . . .
3	#	GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since it happened. I'm so happy for you.
3	#	Oh, come on. You really, really deserve it.
3	#	Are you kidding? I have seen the changes in you the past couple of years. Man, you have grown. You've matured.
3	#	Oh! Well, I just think it's wonderful. Honestly! I've gotta run, but um, please, please give my best to Susan.
3	#	My most, just heartfelt congratulations.
3	#	Yes! Yes, yes. Sure.
3	#	Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.
3	#	I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.
3	#	I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never said that. I said "I've never seen you looser".
3	#	What kind of shopping?
3	#	Where are you going?
3	#	Oh that's a nice store.
3	#	Nothing.
3	#	Literally nothing. I sat in a chair and I stared.
3	#	I told ya.
3	#	Hey.
3	#	That's despicable. How does he know how all coffee drinkers will vote? I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on that jury I wouldn't give you a nickel Kramer.
3	#	What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.
3	#	(Mocking) Jackie says the top was faulty.
3	#	Hello.
3	#	I might be Elaine.
3	#	Oh, Maestro.
3	#	Enchante.
3	#	Jinx buy me a coke.
3	#	I know I know. That is so ahh ......
3	#	Yeah, thanks. O.K. Bye you guys.
3	#	Uh ha.
3	#	Oh God. What are you getting Bob?
3	#	Excuse me?
3	#	Yeah, so?
3	#	Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.
3	#	Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing)
3	#	Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.
3	#	Really?
3	#	Yeah, I called him Maestro.
3	#	Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to it.
3	#	I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".
3	#	He is a Maestro.
3	#	So you say.
3	#	Yeah. (bragging) I'm invited.
3	#	Why?
3	#	Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.
3	#	Hey. Hi Maestro.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	It's BOOKED Jerry!
3	#	(Passionately) Oh Bob! Bob!
3	#	(Correcting herself) Maestro!
3	#	It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed to get away.
3	#	You're right Maestro.
3	#	Hello
3	#	Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep.
3	#	I wish.
3	#	Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person.
3	#	Oh, all right, James. He he he
3	#	Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,
3	#	What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
3	#	At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
3	#	Ah, . . .
3	#	Uh hu.
3	#	I think she'd figure it out.
3	#	What? What is this?
3	#	Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
3	#	I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
3	#	I think I can tell.
3	#	Twenty-five percent.
3	#	You're way off.
3	#	So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population is undateable?
3	#	Then how are all these people getting together?
3	#	(to George who is winking) What is your problem?
3	#	You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
3	#	Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
3	#	You're eye still hurts?
3	#	What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?
3	#	Hello.
3	#	James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!
3	#	Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?
3	#	(mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT !
3	#	Dogs. Oh I love dogs.
3	#	I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started growling at me.
3	#	Huh huh.
3	#	Uh, kind of.
3	#	I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. . . . You know. . . . For a man.
3	#	You got that right.
3	#	Um uh.
3	#	I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. She won't mind if you come.
3	#	Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?
3	#	Oh, I don't remember them.
3	#	Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
3	#	What about this candelabra?
3	#	What did you do, ransack the place after she died?
3	#	I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
3	#	It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. Thanks for mutton.
3	#	Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what you hear.
3	#	Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a
3	#	Did you do with the dogs?
3	#	These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.
3	#	They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one day but I can't tell you right now.
3	#	We'll have to sleep head to toe.
3	#	Head to toe.
3	#	Hey, wake up. It's 830 you were supposed to walk me up at 715.
3	#	You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
3	#	Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her napkins.
3	#	I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.
3	#	They were?
3	#	Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost mauled because of that mutton.
3	#	Oh, I must have left it at Jame's
3	#	Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
3	#	Yeah, you know, head to toe.
3	#	No, because I slept with my back to him.
3	#	You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What are you doing here?
3	#	I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.
3	#	I didn't take your napkins.
3	#	Ask Jerry.
3	#	Uh, this is,
3	#	Yeah. What do you do all day?
3	#	uh-uh.
3	#	Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!
3	#	(laughs)
3	#	No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't! I got that marathon runner coming in tonight.
3	#	You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when I was working at Pendant, editing a book on running...
3	#	Yeah, that's him.
3	#	Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs)
3	#	Ah, I know. I know...!
3	#	Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first race in 3 years.
3	#	What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.
3	#	Eh...he'll get up...
3	#	Hi, Judy.
3	#	Fine. (laughs)
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	(whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes a sad face) Don't say anything to anybody.
3	#	I know, it's just something you have to say...
3	#	Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.
3	#	Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get my deadline extended. I can't...come up with anything for this thing.
3	#	Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed)
3	#	Jerry...
3	#	I've got an alarm, ok?
3	#	It works.
3	#	It... works!
3	#	Hey. Sorry I'm late.
3	#	I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
3	#	What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets the timer) What is the problem?
3	#	uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?
3	#	Oh are you?!
3	#	Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!
3	#	Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up with some load o'crap for that Himalayan walking shoe! I mean, I've given him a place to stay, I'll set an alarm, but I'm not gonna turn my life completely upside down for this guy!
3	#	Hey, Jean-Paul.
3	#	Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)
3	#	Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
3	#	(pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!
3	#	(leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not my microwave, ok? Ok? All right, listen, let's just go. Come on, Jean-Paul, let's go. Let's go.
3	#	(to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?
3	#	Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
3	#	(thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... (hits the keyboard) Oh! This stinks! (grabs a Himalayan walking shoe and starts squeezing it for inspiration) Oh, come on... come on...!...God! (quits)
3	#	Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? (worried) Jean-Paul?! Oh man... (calling Jerry's) Oh...machine.
3	#	Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! Call me back. (hangs up)
3	#	Judy, hi, listen...
3	#	Oh I didn't tell anyone.
3	#	... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)
3	#	Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand times! It's never looked so strange! The faces...so cold! In the distance, a child is crying. Fatherless...a bastard child, perhaps. My back aches...my heart aches...but my feet (stops to look at her feet) ...my feet are resilient! (a big smile grows in her face, as she thinks...) Thank God I took off my heels, and put on my... HIMALAYAN WALKING SHOES!!! (lifting her arms up in the air, in ecstasy, as she says...) Yes!
3	#	Then how did she find out, Jerry?!
3	#	Oh no, thank you.
3	#	There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)
3	#	Go Jean-Paaaaaul!
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Hi Sheila.
3	#	Okay. We ready to go?
3	#	Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.
3	#	What soup place?
3	#	Stunned by soup?
3	#	Huh. All right. Come on.
3	#	Why? What happens if you don't order right?
3	#	What?
3	#	What?
3	#	Oh, boy, I'm really scared!
3	#	All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire.
3	#	How much is this?
3	#	Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things.
3	#	Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.
3	#	I'm getting an armoire, Jerry.
3	#	What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
3	#	But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face.
3	#	Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.
3	#	Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.
3	#	Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.
3	#	Do you need anything?
3	#	Mulligatawny?
3	#	Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?
3	#	All right. I'll be back.
3	#	Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.
3	#	Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?
3	#	Why? What happened?
3	#	[laughing]
3	#	Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup.
3	#	Oh, I know! It is awful!
3	#	I don't know.
3	#	Ohh!
3	#	Ohh! Stop it! I know.
3	#	Ugh!
3	#	You know, we should say something.
3	#	I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	No. Me neither.
3	#	Oh, God!
3	#	Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean?
3	#	Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah!
3	#	Well, I --
3	#	Hmmm?
3	#	What?
3	#	I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am.
3	#	All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire?
3	#	Wha--?
3	#	Street toughs took my armoire?
3	#	I can't believe this!
3	#	Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
3	#	So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?
3	#	Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you.
3	#	Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup.
3	#	Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.
3	#	Hey.
3	#	There he is.
3	#	Yeah. I know. Me, too.
3	#	No. In what way?
3	#	I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody.
3	#	Hello.
3	#	One of these days that guy is gonna get his.
3	#	[gasps]
3	#	Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!
3	#	The K Man did it!
3	#	[laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
3	#	What?
3	#	What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
3	#	Get out!
3	#	The Soup Nazi gave it to you?
3	#	Why?
3	#	[gasps]
3	#	Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful!
3	#	Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
3	#	I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a Soup Nazi. What? What is that?
3	#	Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes!
3	#	So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city.
3	#	What do you care?
3	#	Get out of my way, Jerry.
3	#	Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.
3	#	Hello.
3	#	I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery."
3	#	Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny.
3	#	You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
3	#	Did you hear that? He said, 'nice to meet you.'
3	#	So? We've met before. At Katie Ash's party, we talked for like ten minutes.
3	#	I gotta go talk to him.
3	#	Excuse me, excuse me, Fred?
3	#	You just said, 'nice to meet you', but actually we've met before.
3	#	Yeah, at Katie Ash's party?
3	#	Elaine. You don't remember our conversation? I talked about how my uncle worked in the book depository building with Lee Harvey Oswald?
3	#	When my uncle said to him, 'the president's been shot' Oswald winked at him and said, 'I'm gonna go catch a movie'?
3	#	That was right when we were in front of the bathroom door.
3	#	What was that?
3	#	Alright. So, get a load of this. This guy, Fred Yerkes, remembers every little thing about that night except me.
3	#	What are you saying?
3	#	Yeah, but why? I mean, ya know.
3	#	Ya know?
3	#	Huh, lookit, you got the new catalog.
3	#	Too good. Peterman was so pleased, now he wants to take me out to dinner tomorrow. Maybe you wanna come with me.
3	#	Oh please, Jerry, please please please, I can't sit with him, he tells these stories, it's gonna be awful.
3	#	Oh, hi Fred.
3	#	It's Elaine.
3	#	How ya doin'?
3	#	Yeah, that's too bad.
3	#	Hmm. I never take them.
3	#	Yeah! Yeah, that's right, you remembered!
3	#	Hmm. Tonight.
3	#	No, no no no, none that I can, um, remember.
3	#	(to herself) I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?
3	#	Well, Fred asked me out.
3	#	Yeah, and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy.
3	#	I am? But that's so sick.
3	#	Anyway, so how was the dinner?
3	#	What about Georgie?
3	#	What?
3	#	I got a date.
3	#	Oh, Mr. Peterman.
3	#	Mr. Peterman, you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've gotta get going.
3	#	I have a personal commitment.
3	#	I'm speaking at a women's' rights conference.
3	#	My pleasure.
3	#	Huh.
3	#	(to herself) What am I doing? I'm on a date with this guy because he didn't remember me? He's demented, listen to him...
3	#	Hey.
3	#	You mean in a real Fight Fight?
3	#	George.
3	#	George fights dirty. (she sips her coffee)
3	#	So. Listen ... You're not doing anything tomorrow, are you? Because I have an extra ticket to the historical clothing exhibit at the Met.
3	#	George?
3	#	There's nobody I can go with.
3	#	You know what. I don't have one female friend left.
3	#	Thank you.
3	#	George's Susan?
3	#	Yeah. Why not Susan. I should be friends with Susan. (smacks her forehead with hand) Of course! Susan! Oh! OK, Ill see you guys. Huh. (rushes out the door.)
3	#	Hey George.
3	#	(sitting up in bed) Nothing much, um. Can I talk to Susan
3	#	No, George really. Can I talk to Susan?
3	#	Because I want to ask her to lunch and to the Met tomorrow.
3	#	Why not?
3	#	George, are you going to put her on the phone?
3	#	George, are you going to let me talk to Susan, or Not?
3	#	Well what about that number Susan B. Anthony wore to the 19th Amendment party. Hnuh. Eye yye yye.
3	#	Ha, ha, ha, ha, well it must have been one hell of a party.
3	#	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
3	#	What?
3	#	What? You can tell me. Ill put it in the vault.
3	#	Mm-Hmm.
3	#	Oh, I don't know, you know, girlie stuff.
3	#	That's really what you think girls do, isn't it?
3	#	All rightee. (turns and walks to the bathroom)
3	#	Yeah? Well I don't really give a Sh... (closing the bathroom door)
3	#	Who? Who is Ramon?
3	#	What pool guy?
3	#	Yeah, no problem.
3	#	You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.
3	#	Yeah and I was just leaving. Bye-bye Jerry. (smiling as she closes the door. Jerry looks at her like he can not believe she left him on his own)
3	#	George I don't even want to get --
3	#	So?
3	#	Well, I didnt tell here to say it.
3	#	I Like Her!
3	#	Ahh, yeah, sure.
3	#	Hmm. (picks up the phone and dials)
3	#	Kramer, is that you?
3	#	Uh, what time does Chow Fun start?
3	#	Uh-huh.
3	#	Uhh, so frustrating!
3	#	Uhh, so you want to join me and Susan for lunch at the coffee shop?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Oh, huh. Well, this should be very interesting.
3	#	Yeah. (sits down next to Susan)
3	#	Ahh.
3	#	(on the phone to) Look Jerry, we'll meet you at the theater. (hangs up the phone) OK, next showings at 900, we can't wait any longer.
3	#	Look, let's just leave him a note, okay?
3	#	Oh, come on, come on, come on. (picks up pad of paper and writes) George, Elaine and I went to see Chunnel ... with Jerry. Love?
3	#	Love ... Susan.
3	#	He could have died
3	#	How can you possibly show your face there again?
3	#	Hi, ah, three for Chunnel -- two adults ... one child. (looking towards Jerry)
3	#	I thought that was pretty good, huh?
3	#	Oh, well come on. You want to go grab a bite to eat?
3	#	Why not?
3	#	Is that tomorrow?
3	#	New jeans?
3	#	Still a 31 waist?
3	#	Lena Small?
3	#	Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity list!
3	#	You're a taking person.
3	#	What's he look like?
3	#	You're buying a speedboat?
3	#	I don't know about that.
3	#	Well...
3	#	Very much.
3	#	Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping today. (Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.)
3	#	Uh, Kramer...
3	#	The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.
3	#	Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves the sponge.
3	#	Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off the market.
3	#	I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store in a 25-block radius.
3	#	Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. What does Susan use?
3	#	You don't know?
3	#	Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.
3	#	Make it ten.
3	#	Twenty sponges should be plenty.
3	#	Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.
3	#	Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
3	#	O.k. Hold on just a second. (Gets up and heads to the bathroom. George knocks at the door.)
3	#	Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
3	#	Ah, Susan uses the sponge.
3	#	Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.
3	#	I can't do it. No way, there's no how. (Tries to push George out the door. George resists.)
3	#	Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. (Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks the door with his foot.)
3	#	I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. (Stamps on George's foot and closes the door.) (To Billy) Hold that thought!
3	#	What?
3	#	Hey, I didn't even use one.
3	#	Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really sponge-worthy.
3	#	Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.
3	#	Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste any of 'em.
3	#	So, you think you're sponge-worthy?
3	#	Run down your case for me again...?
3	#	You going to do something about your sideburns?
3	#	And the bathroom in your apartment?
3	#	The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?
3	#	Alright, let's go. (They head for the bedroom.)
3	#	Yep.
3	#	Nope. (Billy leans in to kiss her.) What are you doing?
3	#	Oh...I don't think so.
3	#	I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. (Pats Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.)
3	#	Hey.
3	#	What kind is that?
3	#	Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?
3	#	You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd. Y... you don't think that I had anything to do with his breakdown, do you?
3	#	Yeah? Well, I got news for you.
3	#	Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?
3	#	(concerned) What? Lloyd is here?
3	#	What? No, no, I'd rather...
3	#	(big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello.
3	#	(reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have to sit in the front row, uhm, (desperately inventing) because uh, because, because he, he forgot his glasses. So uh, thanks for getting us... uhm, we'll see you afterwards.
3	#	I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him on again. Seeing him made me feel very uncomfortable.
3	#	Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there, in the ladies' room.
3	#	Oh. Oh God.
3	#	Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out in a hot bath. It was nice to see you again, Lloyd.
3	#	Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always be using a hose? I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk. It's a waste of water. Couldn't he just use a broom?
3	#	Hey.
3	#	(sits beside Jerry) What?
3	#	(laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was wide open. I musta left it at the theatre.
3	#	Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button too, you know. It's antique ivory. It was my mother's.
3	#	Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?
3	#	Well, uhm... I...
3	#	Uh... I...
3	#	No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!
3	#	Hey. Hey everybody.
3	#	(exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem?
3	#	Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.
3	#	You know, that button looks very familiar.
3	#	I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know, I've been looking all over for it. Did, did you find it here?
3	#	Shall I undo it?
3	#	Oh, thank you.
3	#	Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle.
3	#	(thinking) I can't believe I'm going out with this guy. Wow! He's so cool. Maybe he'll write a song about me. That would be amazing. Oh, Elaine, you are so beautiful. So, so beautiful. Not so mention your personality which is so, so, interesting. If you want, you can quit your job and never work again.
3	#	Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.
3	#	Yeah. Right. (laughing) Like that really matters.
3	#	Oh, yeah.
3	#	Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.
3	#	Yeah. In fact, he....(moaning)
3	#	I don't wanna!
3	#	(sighs) Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to do... everything.
3	#	Yeah. It's surprising.
3	#	No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it wouldn't be nice.
3	#	Exactly.
3	#	So what did he have to say?
3	#	Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
3	#	What did you do that for?
3	#	What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think that we're hot and heavy. I don't want John thinking that I'm hot and heavy if he's not hot and heavy.
3	#	I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me here. I don't wanna make any big, sudden movements. I'll frighten him away.
3	#	How do you know that?
3	#	Ohh!
3	#	Hey. Is that your horse outside?
3	#	Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First guy I like in a really long time. I mean, we're getting along, everything is just great. I mean, all right, so he doesn't do... everything, and then you have to come along with your hot and your heavy.
3	#	He wrote a song about it!
3	#	No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know what this is like? To have no control over a relationship? And - and you feel sick to your stomach all the time? Do you know what that's like?
3	#	You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna happen to you. It has to!
3	#	I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at his late show tonight. I don't wanna upset him. Aw, what the hell, I'll upset him.
3	#	I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know you've got your big showcase coming up later and I know how important it is, I know how hard you work for this night, but I just had to tell you that I never told Jerry hot and heavy. I didn't think we were hot and heavy. I mean - I mean, who's hot and who's heavy?
3	#	Disappointed?
3	#	You were?
3	#	Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved!
3	#	Really?
3	#	What?
3	#	Ohh!
3	#	No. No. Don't be silly, John, you were very good. You just don't have to try so hard. Good luck, honey.
3	#	Yeah, ha ha ha. What have you been up to?
3	#	Oh Tomorrow...?
3	#	I don't know if I can.
3	#	Yeah, I'm just really, really busy.
3	#	Yeah, yeah.
3	#	Ah Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Better, now.
3	#	You know Sue Ellen Mishke?
3	#	Yeah, the woman I grew up with in Maryland, she moved here last year...
3	#	The heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune--
3	#	Yes. Yes I ran into her today. This woman has never, not once, ever, as long as I have known her, worn a bra.
3	#	You don't understand. See, she hasn't changed at all. She stole my boyfriend when I was in high school. (flashback sequence)I was at this party, and I was dating this *really* cute guy, his name was Tom Cosley, by the way, and she goes walking by, in this little floozy outfit, and he follows her, right out the door!
3	#	Her birthday's comin' up, see, so I decided to get her a little present.
3	#	A very traditional, a very supportive, brazier.
3	#	Sue Ellen Mishke? Ah, alright, send her in.
3	#	Hellllloo.
3	#	Ohhhhh. You're....welcome.
3	#	Well, Sue Ellen, it's a, it's not a top, it's a bra.
3	#	My God, are you okay?
3	#	So how did this happen?
3	#	What woman?
3	#	Oh...my God.
3	#	Was it a tall woman, in a black blazer?
3	#	Ohhh! That's Sue Ellen Mishke!
3	#	That's the bra I gave here, she's wearing it as a top! The woman is walking around in broad daylight with nothing but a bra on, she's a menace to society.
3	#	Oh! I got it! Let's sue her!
3	#	Yeah, she's loaded. She's the heiress to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
3	#	Kramer, listen to me. Listen! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Your dreams have been shattered, somebody's got to be held accountable. Come on, we'll take for every penny she's got!
3	#	Yeah, it's a bra.
3	#	w-What is this all about?
3	#	Oh-oh, but-
3	#	Yes, that's correct.
3	#	Oh, no, I-I don't think so.
3	#	Yeah, yeah, thanks.
3	#	Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble gettin' a table.
3	#	(awed) Oh, look at this!
3	#	(excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!
3	#	(excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's model! Oh, I always wanted one of these when I was little.
3	#	What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?
3	#	What d'you think?
3	#	(laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
3	#	Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry.
3	#	Hey!
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. (pointedly) By myself.
3	#	(sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.
3	#	Ach, maybe.
3	#	I don't know.
3	#	(patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the hell up?
3	#	God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike to the first person who could make this pain go away.
3	#	Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.
3	#	(worried) What? What?
3	#	Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?
3	#	Ah hah.
3	#	(seriously worried) Wha...?
3	#	(pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!
3	#	Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
3	#	(big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!
3	#	(after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?
3	#	You really think he wants the bike?
3	#	It took him like ten seconds!
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even know why you ant it. (laughingly) I mean, it's a girl's bike.
3	#	No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like saying, you're hungry enough to eat a horse.
3	#	This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't have the bike.
3	#	(grudging) Alright.
3	#	(in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!
3	#	(pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer.
3	#	Huh?
3	#	Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?
3	#	(bearing up) I'm fine.
3	#	(after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you.
3	#	(shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
3	#	Kramer!!
3	#	Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
3	#	His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was before.
3	#	Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the antique store. What's her name, Christie?
3	#	I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of my neck.
3	#	What d'you care?
3	#	Did you have a nice ride?
3	#	Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!
3	#	(anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) Look at this! Look! Ow. I couldn't even crawl out of bed this morning.
3	#	What? You never told me that.
3	#	Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous.
3	#	Yeah Jerry.
3	#	Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?
3	#	So, that's the situation.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	(shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
3	#	Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing in half.
3	#	Yeah, yeah, y-yeah.
3	#	What?!
3	#	(frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still hurting me, and now you have the bike?!
3	#	Hey, that's my bike! Along the sidewalk comes a happy-looking Newman, pedalling the Schwinn for all he's worth. He rings the bell.
3	#	This is my bike!
3	#	(chasing Newman) No, you better gimme back that bike. Newman, gimme...
3	#	Who was Pippi Longstocking?
3	#	Did she have anything to do with Hitler?
3	#	Hey George.
3	#	(indicating) You remember Katy?
3	#	Ah, you don't have to tell me.
3	#	Oh, you know what? He got engaged.
3	#	(deadpan) Oh, I don't know what I was thinking.
3	#	George. How come you're whispering?
3	#	No.
3	#	Ech, George, I have no idea what you're talking about.
3	#	What?
3	#	Oh, yeah. Yeah, what about her?
3	#	What? (shocked) What?! George, no way. You're engaged!
3	#	Uhh. No George!
3	#	Forget it!
3	#	I can't believe you're buying your father a car.
3	#	(sharp intake of breath) Hoh. A Cadillac! (impressed) Wow.
3	#	I had no idea you had this kind of money.
3	#	Yeah, I thought you were doing okay. I just didn't think you were in this kind of, you know, uh... position.
3	#	(smiling) So, when're you getting back from Florida?
3	#	I don't know. (big smile) Just, things seem a little more exciting when you're around. That's all.
3	#	(squeaky) Sure, sure.
3	#	Jerry, he want me to fix him up with Marisa Tomei. I am not gonna be a part of this!
3	#	You wanna meet her. You wanna see if she likes you?
3	#	(shrill) You're engaged!
3	#	George! It's cheating.
3	#	Yes it is!
3	#	(looking for support) Jerry!
3	#	(distractedly) Yeah, yeah, fine, I'll make...
3	#	Eight-fifty.
3	#	So uh, how are you getting to the airport? D'you need a ride, or...
3	#	You sure? You sure? 'Cos, you know...
3	#	(big smile) Okay.
3	#	Oh, hi. Uhm, is Katy there? (listens) Wh...? Uhm, what? (listens) Oh, really?
3	#	Well, could you tell her Elaine called? Yeah, thanks.
3	#	Huh, she's in the hospital. (concerned) She has an arrhythmia.
3	#	(flirtatious) Hi Jerry.
3	#	(clears throat) I was thinking, I mean, I'm not really doing that much this weekend, and I thought, well, huh, what the hell, maybe I'll come down there and hang out a little.
3	#	Well, it's just two hours by plane...
3	#	Dammit! I got another call. Uh, hang on, don't hang up Jerry.
3	#	Yeah?
3	#	(impatient) Okay, George, I am on the other line. I promise you, I'll get you her number.
3	#	Goodbye.
3	#	(smiling and flirty) Hi.
3	#	So, what d'you think?
3	#	(disappointed) Oh.
3	#	Well, if you need that ride, just uhm, gimme a call. (little laugh) Heh. I can meet you at the gate, Jer.
3	#	(urgent) Jerry? Jerry?
3	#	(breathy) Bye.
3	#	(looking at her watch) Okay, well that's all the time we have for today. Why don't we pick up with this next week?
3	#	I got stuff to do.
3	#	Why not?
3	#	Alibi? What does that have to do with me?
3	#	Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?
3	#	(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.
3	#	What is the difference?
3	#	Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.
3	#	(pointedly) Okay. Fine.
3	#	I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.
3	#	I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.
3	#	(weary) Okay.
3	#	Okay.
3	#	Fine.
3	#	Fine, fine, fine.
3	#	What?
3	#	I don't have a boyfriend.
3	#	(not convinced) Ech.
3	#	I thought my idea was just as good.
3	#	(pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing.
3	#	Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?
3	#	(incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?
3	#	What does he do?
3	#	Just imports? No exports?
3	#	Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?
3	#	(sighs) Yi-yi-yi.
3	#	Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?
3	#	(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?
3	#	(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?
3	#	Hi, Susan.
3	#	Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.
3	#	Oh, sure.
3	#	(disbelief) Wha...?! (uncontrolled laughter) Ha ha ha. Ha, no.
3	#	(laughter) Don't be ridiculous! (laughter) I mean, why would anyone wanna sleep...
3	#	...Well, obviously... You know... (disbelief) Ap..ap, Chu... Why would you think I was having an affair with George?
3	#	(recalling the arranged lie) Yeah, yeah, I did have to talk with him. I definitely had to talk with him. Having a problem with my boyfriend.
3	#	Yeah, Art Vandelay.
3	#	(smiling) No, no. (laughing) Huh-hu-hu. It's okay.
3	#	It is so forgotten.
3	#	Okay. (relieved) Okay, no problem.
3	#	(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.
3	#	(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.
3	#	What'd I say?
3	#	(caught out) I did. Uh...
3	#	(extemporising) Uh... chips.
3	#	Potato.
3	#	(embroidering) Some corn.
3	#	Diapers.
3	#	Oh, no, it's okay.
3	#	Okay.
3	#	(to herself) C'mon, George, pick up. Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.
3	#	Mr. Peterman sent me over here for a physical because as you may or may not know, he and I are going on a trip to Kenya. Africa. My first such mission for the company. The Massai bushmen wear these great sandals and we're gonna knock them off. Not the Massai, the sandals.
3	#	Right.
3	#	Oh, Come on.
3	#	The Tonight Show?
3	#	Are you doing new material?
3	#	I don't think so.
3	#	So what are your parents doing here in new York?
3	#	So what are their plans?
3	#	You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
3	#	Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?
3	#	You're all grown up.
3	#	Ahh.
3	#	They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
3	#	How's that gonna happen?
3	#	What? Why not?
3	#	Opium?
3	#	Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. Strugatz must have made a mistake.
3	#	Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this test. I don't take opium. Let me take another one, please? I'll call the doctor right now, I'll take a pop urine test.
3	#	Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll be ready in three minutes.
3	#	No?
3	#	Kramer, you look terrible.
3	#	What's wrong with your shower?
3	#	Why don't you just go see Jerry?
3	#	Mr Peterman! What are you doing?
3	#	Huh?
3	#	Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not addicted to anything.
3	#	How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand, that's a mistake. But twice?
3	#	I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna meet the bush-men of the Kalahari.
3	#	And the bush-women.
3	#	Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time.
3	#	(as though receiving a revelation) Poppies!
3	#	Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I was testing positive for opium. Poppy seeds!
3	#	Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully I'll get my job back and I will be on my way to Africa.
3	#	Oh c'mon, Newman.
3	#	Jerry?
3	#	Oh.
3	#	Hello. Jerry's not here?
3	#	Huh. (pause) Oh my god.
3	#	A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm dead. I'm going to the doctor's in a half an hour.
3	#	It's a long story.
3	#	What are you gonna do in there?
3	#	You gotta do me a favor.
3	#	Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.
3	#	I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
3	#	Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?
3	#	Well, one of those glasses.
3	#	Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.
3	#	Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.
3	#	Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect.
3	#	It doesn't matter.
3	#	A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass.
3	#	Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!
3	#	Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
3	#	What? Why not?
3	#	But I wanted to see the bushmen.
3	#	Oh, hi, Frank.
3	#	(Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually, I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.
3	#	(Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?
3	#	You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front of the sign that said "Costanza"?
3	#	I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.
3	#	Who is that?
3	#	So, you weren't born here?
3	#	No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.
3	#	He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.
3	#	(Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera stars.
3	#	You know the Three Tenors?
3	#	(Nodding) The other guy.
3	#	(Just making conversation) Oh yeah?
3	#	(Mock enthusiasm) Oh, that's dynamite.
3	#	Who else is on the show?
3	#	(Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!
3	#	(Extremely excited) The other guy?!
3	#	(Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's going to be on the show!
3	#	Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?
3	#	(Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy!
3	#	Who's Sally?
3	#	That's sounds pretty juvenile.
3	#	Did you see that?!
3	#	Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.
3	#	(Blunt, to the point) No.
3	#	Eh, I like mine.
3	#	I don't want it.
3	#	(Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
3	#	Hi.
3	#	(Yelling out) He's got nothin'!
3	#	Well, have you ever considered writing new material?
3	#	(Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
3	#	(Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
3	#	What?
3	#	Is George here?
3	#	It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. Would you mind signing this poster for me?
3	#	(As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.
3	#	(Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?
3	#	(Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) What are you doing?
3	#	So?
3	#	I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give you this.
3	#	No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.
3	#	Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..
3	#	Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle of wine. It spills all over the poster)
3	#	(whispers) Poor bastard.
3	#	(irked) I'm stuck here, editing the stupid catalogue, because of stupid Bob Grossberg.
3	#	Listen, there is something really suspicious about this guy. Every time Mr Peterman tries to assign him any work, he says he can't hear, and it all gets dumped on me.
3	#	I don't know. But I'd like to try that earpiece on, see if it's real.
3	#	Bob, you know what? I'm kinda swamped here. You think you could give me a hand with some of the catalogue?
3	#	(slower and louder) I'm kind of swamped.
3	#	Did you see that? Did you see that, Jerry?
3	#	Yes.
3	#	Alright, listen, we'll have to do this again some other time, okay? I got a lotta work to do.
3	#	Alright.
3	#	(makes an irked noise)
3	#	(really doesn't want to know) Okay, Jerry, please, please. I'm really busy here.
3	#	So what?
3	#	Get out! What'd you do?
3	#	(hopeful) And?
3	#	What d'you mean, sort of? What'd he do?
3	#	So you don't know anything?
3	#	(sarcasm) Alright, good job.
3	#	Can you give us a hand with some of these boxes, Bob?
3	#	Bob!
3	#	(sexily) I want you so bad, Bob. You turn me on...
3	#	...so much. You're so damn...sexy.
3	#	(sexy) Ohh. I'm starting to unbutton.
3	#	(dropping the sexy voice) Anything getting through? Bob?
3	#	(shrugging it off) Oh.
3	#	(pleased) Ah.
3	#	(delighted) Well, thank you Mr Peterman.
3	#	Mr Peterman, you...
3	#	(resigned) Of course, Mr Peterman.
3	#	(flat) Yeah, yeah. Was nice.
3	#	(pushing Bob away) Get offa me! Stop it. Stop it.
3	#	Get offa me!
3	#	Get a hold of yourself, Bob! (throwing Bob back between the seats) Get a hold of yourself!
3	#	Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!
3	#	That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back there if you don't want the coat?
3	#	But you were!!
3	#	What house guest?
3	#	Who is he?
3	#	What is a wig master?
3	#	(looking up to the salesman)
3	#	.....Hi.
3	#	Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking around the crest.
3	#	Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman.
3	#	(giggling) Ohhh!!.
3	#	Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those.
3	#	Yeeeahh!!!
3	#	I think it's great. I think you should get it.
3	#	(laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl)
3	#	But I really did like it
3	#	uhn... Sorry!
3	#	What is the big deal!!
3	#	He dared....
3	#	How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover shop? I mean it's a pretty swanky upscale clientele.
3	#	except for Jerry!(laughs)
3	#	Oh!!!
3	#	Really!...Well actually yeah I did see this ......'mazing little black dress...it was sleeveless....
3	#	Yeah..Yeah...
3	#	Really....but I barely know you.
3	#	Ah! Ah!ah!
3	#	Hey Jerr...
3	#	You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy.
3	#	what about it?
3	#	All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress.
3	#	Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when I'm being worked.
3	#	I just met him this morning.
3	#	. Well this is all very flattering...
3	#	Ok....
3	#	OKAY!!!
3	#	You know... I can't wait to get that dress..
3	#	Arrive?
3	#	But you said it was in the store!.
3	#	But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made.......
3	#	Hi E-an
3	#	E-an
3	#	Oh..Nice to meet you.
3	#	Bye Eeeen.
3	#	So you're giving him a discount too?
3	#	Hem!! No reason.
3	#	Hi!.
3	#	Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for the catalogue.
3	#	You want it?
3	#	You can have ,I don't need it anymore.
3	#	Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig.
3	#	Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too... a man Jerry.
3	#	Some friend of his from England.
3	#	You're nuts!
3	#	What d'you mean?
3	#	Aawwh Please.....
3	#	I can't I 've got to meet a friend.
3	#	Oh Thanks, thank you very much.
3	#	Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take care
3	#	Well, Here we are.
3	#	(sighs)
3	#	So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole Millers are coming in?
3	#	Huh!
3	#	Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive.
3	#	Hello.
3	#	Uhmmm huh! Is it important.?
3	#	Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when the Nicole Millers are coming in from Milan?.
3	#	Well do you have any in a... size four.?
3	#	(sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message. (looks at the sleeping Craig and thinks) They make wigs out of human hair? (still thinking, Ethan's voice) And pay plenty for them.
3	#	One of those fabric wholesalers. This guy Todd Gack. I won a bet from him.
3	#	He bet me Dustin Hoffman was in Star Wars.
3	#	That's what I said.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	What?
3	#	I'll see you later.
3	#	Hi Jerry!
3	#	Hello. This is Todd Gack.
3	#	So what movie are you guys seeing?
3	#	Oh. We were going to see that but it was sold out. So were going to see"Blame it on the Rain"
3	#	What's she going to do? There's no more tickets.
3	#	How did you do that?
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Huh. Yeah thanks for getting us tickets too.
3	#	No. We were both in the mood for one.
3	#	Oh is that so.
3	#	What are you talking about?
3	#	If he wanted to ask me out why didn't he just ask me.
3	#	I don't buy it.
3	#	Nothing. He walked me home.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	No it's not.
3	#	That's just because your a jackass.
3	#	No, no.
3	#	I am supposed to meet him to pick up your cigars.
3	#	Your crazy!
3	#	Thanks for the dinner.
3	#	Hey Todd. Let me ask you a question. Um. Was this whole date thing just a way of asking me out?
3	#	I mean Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
3	#	Oh all right. Okay well, goodnight.
3	#	See what is that? Is that a date?
3	#	All right. I am sorry it's not a date.
3	#	All right.
3	#	This is nice.
3	#	Party of four? Who are we meeting?
3	#	Hellllllooooo.
3	#	What the hell was that?
3	#	Why did you introduce me to your parents?
3	#	Come on Todd. Admit it, this is a date.
3	#	Saturday night with your parents. Unless I'm your sister this is a date.
3	#	Well if it's not a date then what is it?
3	#	I don't believe this.
3	#	No. I'll just walk home.
3	#	Now what was that?
3	#	Hey Todd.
3	#	Yeah sure.
3	#	Milhouse.
3	#	These are terrible.
3	#	What kind of a name is Todd Gack anyway.
3	#	Where are you going?
3	#	But she broke up with you.
3	#	It smells like a rubber fire.
3	#	I said rubber fire.
3	#	Did you ever pay Todd for these things?
3	#	Hi, Mr Peterman.
3	#	I do.
3	#	The pygmy pullover.
3	#	Whatever.
3	#	Oh. (pleasant surprise) Oh yeah, I'd be happy to. Uhm, how much d'you want this thing? (smilingly) I mean, you know, how high are you willing to go?
3	#	Wow.
3	#	No, I didn't hear anything. (she spots a familiar face) Oh, my God, look who's here.
3	#	Hi Sue Ellen.
3	#	(faked laughter) Oh, ho ha ha. No, no, I'm actually here to bid, Sue Ellen. I mean that is if anything is to my liking.
3	#	(half under her breath and half to Jerry) I... hate that woman.
3	#	(loudly, for the benefit of Sue-Ellen) Oh. Those are handsome. Look at that set. Yeah, think I might bid on those.
3	#	(to Jerry) What is she doing? She's starting in on the bidding now? (to Auctioneer) Eighty-five hundred!
3	#	Ninety-five hundred.
3	#	(determined) Eleven thousand!
3	#	(angrier) Thirteen thousand!
3	#	(vicious) Fifteen thousand!!
3	#	Peterman is gonna kill me.
3	#	Why didn't you stop me?
3	#	(listening) A little.
3	#	Oh. You know what? (indicates clubs) I'm gonna grab these from you later. You'll take care of 'em, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow.
3	#	Alrighty, bye.
3	#	I know, Mr Peterman, but but but but once I saw them, I just couldn't stand to let anyone else have them. (warming to her subject) You know, certainly not some stuck-up candy bar heiress who shamelessly flaunts herself in public without any regard...
3	#	(ingratiatingly) They should be here today.
3	#	Hi, it's me.
3	#	Listen, I need to come over and pick up the clubs for Peterman.
3	#	(worry) Oh no. What?
3	#	You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
3	#	Oh, go down and get them.
3	#	Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll just go and pick 'em up myself.
3	#	(resigned) Ugh, okay, alright, fine.
3	#	Hey. Where's the car?
3	#	Good.
3	#	So? What'd they say?
3	#	What the hell were you thinking leaving my clubs in that car?!
3	#	What kind of maniac is this guy?
3	#	What am I supposed to tell Mr Peterman.
3	#	Why couldn't you take better care of that car?!
3	#	Mr Peterman, uh... There seems to be a bit of a snag.
3	#	It seems that a psychotic mechanic has absconded with my friend's car.
3	#	They happened to be in the back seat at the time.
3	#	(to George) Hey.
3	#	(to Jerry) Hey. What did the detective say?
3	#	(makes surprise noise) Are the clubs in it? Ask him.
3	#	(explaining) We used to date, but now we're just friends.
3	#	(horrified) Huuh! (she turns away and covers her mouth)
3	#	Oh, my God.
3	#	Uuh.
3	#	Uhh
3	#	(sobbing happiness) It's a tu-hur-bo.
3	#	Elaine Benes.
3	#	Oh my god, where is it?
3	#	Are the clubs there?
3	#	Alright, I'm heading over right now.
3	#	What's the status?
3	#	Well, have they called the police yet?
3	#	What? Why not?
3	#	Kramer has a record.
3	#	Keep following him.
3	#	I need those clubs.
3	#	Those are JFK's golf clubs!
3	#	Stop the truck, Kramer. Pick up the clubs!
3	#	(quietly) Can you stop and pick up those clubs Kramer?
3	#	(not the soul of happiness) Yep. Lemme get 'em for you, Mr Peterman.
3	#	The uh, the letter of, authenticity's in the side pocket there.
3	#	(spotting a chance to keep her job) Oh. Oh yeah. The only thing worse was his slice. (she laughs nervously)
3	#	Have a good game.
3	#	(Looking up from a menu) Yeah.
3	#	Is that good?
3	#	Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in for confidentiality) You know, I heard a rumor their marriage was a little rocky.
3	#	Mm-hmm.
3	#	Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)
3	#	Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.
3	#	Oh, (Laughs at George's misfortune) that's mine.
3	#	Well, my friend, Elise, lent it to me for the week. She's out of town.
3	#	(Overly generous) Hi, David!
3	#	God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How about a left turn signal, ya moron?!
3	#	You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks up the car phone) I'm gonna check my messages. (Begins to dial as she pulls up to a pedestrian crosswalk. She stops right before hitting a man crossing the street)
3	#	Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth got separated last night!
3	#	They're gettin' divorced! (Quickly breaks, stopping traffic)
3	#	So, now, what is our move? What do we do?
3	#	(Agreeing) Mm.
3	#	Right.
3	#	Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving time.
3	#	(Nodding) Yeah, yeah..
3	#	Then why are we calling?
3	#	Ah! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."
3	#	Then, after a period of being "there for you", we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Yeah, I thought you were being folksy.
3	#	Kramer, they're painted on!
3	#	(Mock sympathy) Well.. David, it happens.
3	#	Because it's really nobody's business.
3	#	"There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..
3	#	And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
3	#	You're gonna pick up the pieces.
3	#	10th
3	#	Right
3	#	Well, David the thing about George is that he's an idiot.
3	#	Did I have a great time with David Lickner last night? I sure did. (Jerry comes over to the couch with a beverage and sits down) Do I think there is a future here? I don't see why not.
3	#	Ooooh, please.
3	#	Ah come on
3	#	Aaalright!
3	#	Mmmnn, Georgie!
3	#	Right
3	#	Well thanks to you and your little comment there to David and Beth. Jerry and I are in prime pouncing position to scoop these two up (Jerry and Elaine do a little slow dance of joy) before they know what hit em.
3	#	Ya
3	#	(Put her finger in George's face) You be careful George.
3	#	What
3	#	is it?
3	#	Dam
3	#	What do we do? You get your ass over to Beth's, toot sweet. That's what you do and turn on some of that so called charm you're always telling me about.
3	#	(Pushing Jerry) You don't try, you Do It! I got the loser in this relationship and I'm breathing new life into him, you give me three more days, he won't be able to remember her name. You got the winner, you got the easy part. Alright let's go (claps) I'll drive you over there. Come on.
3	#	What? I'm parked right outside, let's go. Come on (grabs Jerry's arm) come on.
3	#	(pulling Jerry out the door) Nah It doesn't matter come on, I'll take you.
3	#	What's your Problem?
3	#	(Car tires screeching) Woah, ahhh. Hehe Ha ha ha. That was close. Confide in her, open up to her. You know women like that.
3	#	My father left us when I was 9 so I guess that is why i have such a fear of abandonment.
3	#	Yes it is.
3	#	Oh, maybe we should go some place else.
3	#	Hi
3	#	and here.
3	#	(takes a huge shot) I'll tell ya, it's not bad.
3	#	Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just realized; the wedding is like a month away.ha..haa..
3	#	What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding party?
3	#	Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be the usher so what am I gonna be?
3	#	Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What about being a bridesmaid.
3	#	Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?
3	#	You don't ask.. You tell.
3	#	Start smoking.
3	#	Really?
3	#	Yeah! You're probably right.
3	#	No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick of being single. I'm getting out.
3	#	Yep! just you and Kramer.
3	#	So I'm not gonna be an usher?
3	#	So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher and I am nothing.
3	#	Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I can't be an usher at he wedding.
3	#	Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the singles table with all the losers.
3	#	Did you try the cigarettes?
3	#	I wouldn't sign one.
3	#	I wonder what happened?
3	#	I'm so sorry George
3	#	All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)
3	#	It was unbelievable. Six weeks of traveling through Mexico all on Peterman's peso.
3	#	Oh, tons!
3	#	(laughs sarcastically) You don't respect my work at all, do you?
3	#	So what's been going on around this dump? How's your fiancee?
3	#	Jeannie... your fiancee.
3	#	All right. Spill it, Jerome.
3	#	You've never felt remorse.
3	#	I bet your parents were upset, huh?
3	#	You haven't told them yet, have you?
3	#	Well, Mr. Peterman, I've got a really good idea for a hat. It combines the spirit of old Mexico with a little big city panache. I like to call it the Urban Sombrero.
3	#	Are you okay, Mr. Peterman?
3	#	Well, see, it's... businessmen taking siestas. You know, it's the, uh, the Urban Sombrero.
3	#	Mr. Peterman?
3	#	(answers the phone) Hello, Mr. Peterman, how are you feeling?
3	#	What? Well, who's gonna do it?
3	#	Me? Why me?
3	#	Mr. Peterman, you can't leave.
3	#	Burma?
3	#	Mr. Peterman?
3	#	Burma.
3	#	Jerry, he wants me to run the catalog! It's crazy! I can't be in charge!
3	#	I mean, I can't give people orders!
3	#	I am not qualified to run the catalog!
3	#	Oh, Peterman ran off to Burma, and now he wants me to run the catalog.
3	#	Well, I'm just gonna tell him no. I can't run the catalog.
3	#	Karate?
3	#	Katra?
3	#	Well, you know, I, I have watched Peterman run the company.
3	#	I know how to do it. Pair of pants, a stupid story, a huge markup. I can do that.
3	#	(excitedly) Okay.
3	#	You got that straight. Now I want four new ideas from each of you by 600. No, make that six ideas by 400. All right, let's move, move, move, move, move!
3	#	(picking up) Jerry!
3	#	Hey. Guess who just finished laying out her first issue of the J. Peterman Catalog.
3	#	(muffled, as she's smoking a cigar) It's a peach.
3	#	I say, it's a peach.
3	#	No, no, no. It's weak. No one's gonna buy it, and you shouldn't be selling it.
3	#	Hey, hey. Me. Talking. You know, between you and me, I always thought Kramer was a bit of a doofus, but he believed in me. *You* did not. So as I see it, he's not the doofus. *You* are the doofus.
3	#	Yeah. You, Jerry, are the doofus.
3	#	Oh, well, maybe I'll just go down there and thank him in person.
3	#	Kramer!
3	#	What are you doing?
3	#	You never said you were fighting children.
3	#	This is what you used to build me up? This is where you got all that stupid katra stuff?
3	#	Search... for Spock?!
3	#	(pushes him) You doofus!
3	#	Yep.
3	#	Shot.
3	#	Gone.
3	#	(raises her hand) Yo.
3	#	It's the Urban Sombrero. I put it on the cover.
3	#	(pointing a finger accusingly at Kramer) You! This is all your fault! You told me I could run the company!
3	#	Well, I'll see ya... (exits)
3	#	Well, that's...that's sweet.
3	#	Oh, hey, you know...I had a piece of whitefish over at Barney Greengrass the other day...
3	#	I really like the city.
3	#	Uh, it was in the Hamptons.
3	#	No, no, that's okay, it's uh...
3	#	The New Yorker has poetry.
3	#	They're my friends, but they act as if having a baby takes some kind of talent.
3	#	Why? Because I can?
3	#	Yes! I think I am better than the mollusk!
3	#	Oh, I'm sorry.
3	#	Yeah, like you must procreate.
3	#	Oh, it's been done to death. (smiles)
3	#	So, Kevin. If I don't want children, does that make me a bad humanitarian?
3	#	Cause, I mean, when you get to know me, you'll see that I'm a pretty good humanitarian. (Waitress comes to the table and pours more coffee.) You are doing a wonderful job, by the way. Thanks a lot. (To Kevin) Right? Am I right? (Kramer walks by.) Kramer. Kramer! Come here, look at my new friend Kevin. (Kramer and Kevin shake hands.) Oh, you got a little, uh...
3	#	Oh. Are you alright?
3	#	You know, Jerry has one of those every time he bombs on stage.
3	#	Oh, no...that won't last.
3	#	He's not ga-ga.
3	#	Well, I hear three distinct sounds. A low rumple...followed by a metallic 'squink'...
3	#	...followed by a mysterious...'glonk.'
3	#	Well, one question does come to mind. Have you considered just...asking them what happened to the briefcase?
3	#	Ga-ga? When did that happen?
3	#	Well, maybe we should double. I'm pretty ga-ga myself.
3	#	Yeah, but we have a common goal.
3	#	Yeah, of course.
3	#	Oh, please. He wouldn't say that.
3	#	Oh, Kevin...you can go on and on about how you don't want kids...and it sounds, it sounds really nice, but...the truth is, I don't know if you mean it or not.
3	#	Although, I have a hunch you mean it.
3	#	I know, I don't want...(clears her throat)...kids.
3	#	Well, Kevin, maybe I have a little doubt. I mean, nothing is a hundred percent.
3	#	What?
3	#	Really?
3	#	You know, that's weird, actually, 'cause I'm sort of the same way. I mean once for like, no reason, I flattened my hair and I had all these strands hanging in my face all the time...
3	#	Sometimes I think about wearing my hair real short.
3	#	Yeah!
3	#	What are you guys doing here?
3	#	Why?
3	#	What?
3	#	I cut it.
3	#	Kevin's having his vasectomy reversed.
3	#	Look. Kevin. I really like you, heh, heh, uh. But, um, maybe we'd be, better off just being.. friends. (takes a bite of her sandwich)
3	#	Well. I mean. (distracted by the food) Oh, god. This tuna tastes like an old sponge.
3	#	(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.
3	#	(dry) I put her stats on the back.
3	#	(laughs in appreciation) You are not gonna believe this! I told him that I just wanted to be friends. He's fine with it. He really wants to be friends.
3	#	(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.
3	#	(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)
3	#	No, I need it.
3	#	(pause) Man, Hands?
3	#	(weary) (Look,) would you, prefer it, if she had, no hands at all?
3	#	Do uh, do hooks make it more attractive, Jerry?
3	#	(getting up to go) Uh.. Listen, you're picking me up from my (place tomorrow)--
3	#	Okay, I've got five, huge boxes of (buttons).
3	#	(weary) Jerry!
3	#	Where were you today?
3	#	Pick. Up.
3	#	So? Where were you?!
3	#	(irritated, throwing down her bag) I had to ask Kevin, to leave his office an' come an' pick me up!
3	#	Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.
3	#	(pause) Bizarro Jerry?
3	#	(pause) Shouldn't he say "Bad bye"? Isn't that the, opposite of "Good bye"?
3	#	Uh. Does he live underwater?
3	#	Is he black..
3	#	I know, he's so tiny!
3	#	(to self in head) Bizarro world..
3	#	(to self in head) This is unbelievable..
3	#	Well, I gotta say that I think that that is a fantastic idea, Feldman!
3	#	What are you gonna do down there?
3	#	(pause, then vaguely waves while watching them leave) Hello?
3	#	What? What is goin' on with you two?
3	#	All right, listen. Have you seen my addre-- (sees address book on counter) --ah! There it is. Okay. I got it. I'll see you later. (leaving)
3	#	(stops, pause) Well, I. (a little ashamed) I guess I been at Reggie's..
3	#	Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..
3	#	Books, Jerry.
3	#	Well! I can't spend the rest of my life coming into this stinking apartment every ten minutes to pore over the, excruciating minutia, of every, single, daily event..
3	#	I'll see you later man. I gotta go.
3	#	Jerry.. George, Kramer.. This is Kevin, Gene.. and Feldman.
3	#	(diplomatically to KEVIN, GENE, and FELDMAN) Could you guys excuse us, just for a moment.
3	#	(pause) Thanks. (to JERRY, GEORGE, and KRAMER) What.. what do you guys want..
3	#	(pause, turns back to JERRY et al.) Guys. I gotta go. Take it easy.
3	#	I'm, I'm sorry.. We've already got a George..
3	#	(off-camera) It's Lainey!
3	#	Hi (?). Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh!
3	#	Okay. Hi Gene! (comfortably tosses her bag to the left, it falls on the floor) Uh-ha! (smiling, picks up her bag, puts it on a chair that's to the right)
3	#	What's up?
3	#	Eatin' olives.
3	#	Oh! (comes to him)
3	#	Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)
3	#	Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?
3	#	(turning to them, awkward) It's locked..
3	#	(Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green.
3	#	You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction.
3	#	I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'.
3	#	I drive my people hard, and then I reward them.
3	#	Exactly.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Uh huh.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	George, I just don't want you interfering.
3	#	Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances)
3	#	I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)
3	#	Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?
3	#	Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.
3	#	He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected.
3	#	All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it?
3	#	Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night?
3	#	Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?
3	#	Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him.
3	#	Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
3	#	Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen.
3	#	Yeah, we're good friends.
3	#	Hey, have you seen Anna?
3	#	To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
3	#	Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too!
3	#	(To George) Stay away from her.
3	#	(To Anna) Get in the car.
3	#	You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.
3	#	What? What is so funny?
3	#	At Yankee Stadium?
3	#	Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.
3	#	Who did that? Who did that?!?
3	#	Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?
3	#	It's dancing.
3	#	I dance fine.
3	#	He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?
3	#	Jerry, do I stink?
3	#	But I really enjoy dancing.
3	#	It's that bad?
3	#	George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you.
3	#	Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.
3	#	Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person.
3	#	I never should have given Anna the impression--
3	#	--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.
3	#	What?
3	#	I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
3	#	George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George?
3	#	No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.
3	#	Anna...
3	#	All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters)
3	#	All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
3	#	You got that right.
3	#	That means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
3	#	I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
3	#	Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it.
3	#	Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that.
3	#	You were big.
3	#	Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while.
3	#	Difficult?
3	#	Well it's, it's..... You know I noticed that somebody wrote in my chart that I was difficult in January of 92 and I have to tell you that I remember that appointment exactly. You see this nurse asked me to put a gown on but it was a mole on my shoulder and I specifically wore a tank top so I wouldn't have to put a gown on. You know there made of paper.
3	#	But it was in pen. You fake erase.
3	#	What are you writing? Doctor.
3	#	You are not going to believe what happened to me at the doctors office today.
3	#	No, no. I was looking at my chart and it said I was difficult. Why would they write that?
3	#	Then the doctor writes more stuff down and doesn't even look at my rash.
3	#	Oh come on. I'm not difficult. I'm easy.
3	#	Listen to me you little shi........
3	#	Oh it's my pleasure. I love these. In fact I got one at home. It's perfect when you just want to throw something on.
3	#	Where did you get my chart?
3	#	You know I can tell you my whole history. Let's just.......
3	#	Please, please. It's really, really itchy.
3	#	And then he starts writing on my chart.
3	#	You can't change your chart. It's your chart.
3	#	You are!?!
3	#	Yeah. I sent one to everyone I know. Remember my Christmas card.
3	#	Actually I thought he was very professional.
3	#	Oh yeah. In fact I like the picture so much I cropped out the nipple and am using as my health club ID.
3	#	Yeah it is nice actually.
3	#	I need to see Dr. Burke right away. This rash is spreading.
3	#	Oh come on. Have some compassion. Okay well I hope it's contagious
3	#	Come on. Move. (elevator doors reopen; Dr. Burke and two orderlies are revealed) Oh hi Dr. Burke. I didn't know if uh....
3	#	Oh please no more.
3	#	So it wasn't a bomb.
3	#	Well then what?
3	#	But he's okay?
3	#	Yeah I am still holding.
3	#	What?!? He doesn't have one appointment this whole month!?! Oh come on. I am dying here man. Hello, hello.
3	#	Jerry I am at doctor Zimmerman. I am at the end of the alphabet.
3	#	There on vacation. Every doctor in this city seems to know who I am .
3	#	Dr. Resnick. He's not listed.
3	#	Hello.
3	#	Yes. Who it this?
3	#	Yeah. What is this all about
3	#	Hello, hello.
3	#	Oh uh uh...
3	#	Leo. Has the doctor been in yet?
3	#	Okay listen Leo. Your hairless, your scared. When the doctor comes in let me do the talking. Okay.
3	#	I should have never left him alone.
3	#	I am his nurse... Poloma.
3	#	He has good days and bad.
3	#	And he's has a bit of a rash.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	I don't like this, it is to easy.
3	#	Shut up! I think he's on to us.
3	#	Shhhhhh. Here.
3	#	Get in there. Get chart. Get out. You got it.
3	#	This.
3	#	Okay.
3	#	Benes. My last name is Benes you jackass. Yeah.
3	#	Where's my chart? Did you get it?
3	#	What? What happened?
3	#	Hey, Jer. Are you going to this Bob Sacamano party?
3	#	What? You're kidding, I just got this invitation today. Oh, I was so excited. It's really a beautiful invitation.
3	#	Wait a minute; this postmark is three weeks old. Man, this happens all the time. (Into intercom) Jeanine? Who the hell runs the mailroom?
3	#	Alright, send him up here.
3	#	I'm gonna do a little firing.
3	#	Oh yeah, sure. (hangs up) Gimme a break.
3	#	Oh, great. Send him in.
3	#	Eddie. Yes, um, I am so sorry but I'm afraid we're gonna have to... promote you.
3	#	Well, I called him all the way up to my office, so I had to tell him something important. So I promoted him.
3	#	Copywriter.
3	#	Well it can't be any worse than the pointless drivel we normally churn out.
3	#	I'm not Jewish.
3	#	(reading) At the Knights of Columbus?
3	#	(reading) A tempting schmear of authentic Jewish delicacies.
3	#	That's good work, guys. That aught to do it for today.
3	#	Oh, Eddie, well it's your first day.
3	#	Oh, okay.
3	#	What am I gonna do? He is a disaster.
3	#	You know what? You are exactly right. That is what I should do, I should promote him. I'll give him another office on another floor and he can sit there with his nice title and his bayonet and stop freakin' me out.
3	#	Before we get started, I am happy to tell you that Eddie Sherman is no longer writing for this catalog.
3	#	He's upstairs, I made him Director of Corporate Development.
3	#	Well, no, I would hardly--
3	#	Relax--
3	#	Well, hey? Hey. Hey!!
3	#	Oh.
3	#	You know, Eddie, that might be just a tad harsh for womenswear.
3	#	Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel" and "scar tissue" with "string of pearls" and "raspberry scones".
3	#	I don't know how we did it, but there's some kind of chemistry between us, we turned out one hell of a catalog.
3	#	Hey Ed, let me ask you something. What's with the fatigues and all the psychotic imagery? Huh?
3	#	Come on, don't be a baby.
3	#	That's it?
3	#	Mm. This food is fantastic.
3	#	I can't get off the kishkas.
3	#	You're quitting?
3	#	Well, you can't quit, you're all I've got. I need you!
3	#	Ugh, the whole country's sick to their stomach.
3	#	What is this, a 'bit'?
3	#	Cos I'm not in the mood.
3	#	Yeah, I know that tone. This is a bit.
3	#	(tired) Alright, are you done with your little amusement?
3	#	It was okay, but move the 'medication for the well' to the front, and hit the word 'good' harder.
3	#	So, your firm designed all the furniture in here?
3	#	(as if she knows) Oh, Farbman.
3	#	Mm, love Farbman.
3	#	Wuh, if you call that living. (laughs) Ahaha.
3	#	Wouldn't it be great if Farbman designed shoes?
3	#	Brett? Don't you think that would be great?
3	#	Brett?
3	#	Huh?
3	#	He's not a jerk, Jer. He only works with Karl Farbman.
3	#	(dismissive) I dunno, some designer. Anyway, Brett is so generous, and sensitive. Last night he was moved just listening to a song.
3	#	Desperado.
3	#	Uh huh.
3	#	Uh huh.
3	#	That, had to be invented?
3	#	(skeptical) Oh hoh, really? Well, why don't we ask him about it?
3	#	Excuse me. Hey, how you doing. Uhm, my, uh, friend here says that he invented that little twirl you're doing.
3	#	(looking at Jerry) Ohh.
3	#	Alright, can we (glances at her watch) go?
3	#	What's with the claw?
3	#	Oh, Brett. (indicating) This is Jerry.
3	#	Have you seen the chest of drawers that Brett gave to Kramer?
3	#	You gotta see 'em. Beautiful.
3	#	Mmm. Brett, uhm, Jerry doesn't have a fax machine.
3	#	Oh. Jerry, you wanna join us?
3	#	(warning) Jerry.
3	#	Why? Why d'you think he's upset?
3	#	(romantic) We're not gonna talk about Karl Farbman all night, are we?
3	#	(surprised) Brett? Everything alright?
3	#	(worried) Brett! What is it? Is there someone outside?
3	#	(relieved) Oh. Oh, oh, phew. You know, for a minute there I thought it was like that urban legend about the guy with the hook who's hanging on the fender...
3	#	(apologetic, silently mouthed) Sorry.
3	#	Ah, I think I'm on the outs with Brett. I got shushed during Desperado.
3	#	He is just in his own world when he hears that song. It's like, I'm sitting there in the car, and he's.. out riding fences.
3	#	Yes. You're right. We need to find 'our' song.
3	#	(points) I like Witchy Woman.
3	#	You know, Witchy Woman. (sings) 'Ooo-ooh, wit-chay woman'.
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Fifty thousand yen? Isn't that only a few hundred dollars?
3	#	In them?!
3	#	Shh-shh! (smiling) What d'you think?
3	#	What are you doing? That's Witchy Woman. That could be our song.
3	#	Oh. Oh, then how about Desperado? (smiling) We can share it.
3	#	Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman.
3	#	Boogey?
3	#	No. He blew out my Witchy Woman, and he won't share Desperado. Hey, what d'you think of Oye Como Va?
3	#	(desperation) Well, I'm running outta guys here in this city, Jer!
3	#	Brett, believe me. You don't have to do this.
3	#	Uh, I promise you, Jerry is not jealous of Kramer's cabinet.
3	#	Jerry?
3	#	Jerry.
3	#	Calm down Brett, okay. You could have a concussion. Calm down. (holds Brett's head and sings) 'Desperado, mmm-mm-mmm. You better...'
3	#	What do you think of the catalog?
3	#	There, we just talked business.
3	#	Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other stuff.
3	#	I'll take it.
3	#	Why not? (To the Sales Woman) And some hair for my little friend here.
3	#	...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a Water Pik.
3	#	Sure. Water Pik, floss, Plax, brush, Listerine.
3	#	Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another call.
3	#	Hello?
3	#	Oh hey! How things doing in accounting?
3	#	Well, I am the President.
3	#	Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?
3	#	Good day.
3	#	Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?
3	#	Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.
3	#	The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?
3	#	What?
3	#	Ohh. (trying to control the Water Pik and shut it off.)
3	#	What do you mean you don't have the hat?
3	#	No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!
3	#	Dial 9- MERLIN.
3	#	Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...
3	#	... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)
3	#	Ah, (releases Georges ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.
3	#	I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.
3	#	George...
3	#	... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.
3	#	Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?
3	#	Uhhh...
3	#	This is an absolute disaster.
3	#	You stole her clock?
3	#	Well done. (pats George on the shoulder)
3	#	So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?
3	#	You look a little stressed.
3	#	So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.
3	#	I thought he was Kramer's friend.
3	#	Forty bucks? Are they Sable?
3	#	Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.
3	#	w-w- Well, that's a -ah, its kind of Sable.
3	#	That's a rat hat?
3	#	But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.
3	#	Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?
3	#	What?
3	#	Kneel?
3	#	Mr. Peterman.
3	#	You speak Burmese?
3	#	Ah.
3	#	No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)
3	#	I - I work for your mail order catalog.
3	#	Well actually um, I do have a bill here. If you could just sign, this expense form, I think I could still make the last fan boat out of here.
3	#	Right... (nodding)
3	#	This the Urban Sombrero, I put it on the last catalog cover.
3	#	Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.
3	#	No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.
3	#	Huh?
3	#	Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. Let's just move on. (Phone rings)
3	#	So do most doctors like ER or do you guys just think it's fake?
3	#	Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to you.
3	#	When do you take this exam?
3	#	Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I mean, people do call you doctor.
3	#	Well, can I introduce you as doctor?
3	#	All right, that's all I wanted to know.
3	#	So when they're handing you those cadavers, do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?
3	#	Oh my God.
3	#	It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)
3	#	Oh hi, Sue Ellen.
3	#	Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.
3	#	Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's a very good doctor.
3	#	Well, there's a doctor right here.
3	#	Can't you at least tell him what to do?
3	#	I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes he could've helped.
3	#	Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)
3	#	What? What is with all these books?
3	#	What is your answer to number 74?
3	#	No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!
3	#	Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
3	#	Portuguese?
3	#	How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?
3	#	I don't know. It's just the last coupla days my mind has been, not good.
3	#	What? What are you talking about?
3	#	I don't understand.
3	#	Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie the blank.
3	#	Pooh...(laughing)
3	#	Not good. I'm a moron.
3	#	Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. You got eleven minutes?
3	#	I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing to do with you.
3	#	You could read the paper through the whole thing if you want.
3	#	Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?
3	#	Congratulations! You passed!
3	#	What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating a doctor?
3	#	Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?
3	#	Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals".. huh.
3	#	Yeah?
3	#	(Shocked) Stabbed?!
3	#	That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
3	#	Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.
3	#	Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned on by the stabbing) I mean, to be stab-worthy.. You know, it's.. kind of a compliment.
3	#	Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did the song about?
3	#	I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
3	#	I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me, (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures. Alan is getting edgy about it, and even more so with every wave) and I will eat it until my stomach pops! (Notices Alan's unsettled) Oh.. (Puts the knife down)
3	#	(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?
3	#	What? Was she just so crazy in love with you that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?
3	#	(Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!
3	#	Right, so, I called my friend, you know - the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.
3	#	(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.
3	#	Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.
3	#	(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.
3	#	(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.
3	#	Pardon?
3	#	(Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again) That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)
3	#	Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with the mail?
3	#	Well, anyway, get this I spoke to Alan. You know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me "big head".
3	#	(Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.
3	#	Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?
3	#	(Gives a "That's a shame" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)
3	#	What?
3	#	(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?
3	#	Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down)
3	#	(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!
3	#	(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.
3	#	(Getting up to leave) Alright.
3	#	(Shrugging it off) Oh, please.
3	#	(Casually playing along) So what?
3	#	(Suddenly angry) What?!
3	#	I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?
3	#	Five minutes? That's it?
3	#	I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's for like, forty minutes.
3	#	So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.
3	#	When did you tell George to be here?
3	#	About five.
3	#	Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and Kramer.
3	#	No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.
3	#	What? Clinging to some scraps?
3	#	Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced a clown check!
3	#	Hm. (looking at Kurt's driver's license photo) Hey, driver's license. Oh...my God.
3	#	Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.
3	#	Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? I mean wi..with you under it? (Kurt shrugs.)
3	#	Here. (Shows Kurt's driver's license to Jerry.) Take a look at that.
3	#	No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair.
3	#	And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's all mine. (clutches the photo between her hands and to her chest then looks at it again)
3	#	It's not just hair! Look!
3	#	It's chestnut with auburn highlights!
3	#	You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's hair is.
3	#	I'm sorry, George, but it's true.
3	#	Ohhh, it's coming in already!
3	#	Wow, you have some very nice little seedlings here. Huh...
3	#	Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.
3	#	Well, I don't know... h- how long have you been shaving your head for?
3	#	Huh.
3	#	Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
3	#	You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.
3	#	You already ate?
3	#	Kurt!
3	#	Hey hey Kurt, slow down! I can't just marry you, whim-bam-boom! I mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous" time...
3	#	Yeah, yeah, that too.
3	#	(sighs Wa-ah) I don't know...a year?
3	#	(sighs ahh) Could I see the ring again?
3	#	Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. Those'll be good times.
3	#	Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. What am I clinging to?
3	#	Stop _ the _ fight!
3	#	Why? Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
3	#	So, how long are you gonna be in here for?
3	#	(sighs) So 10 to 14 months.
3	#	So, you understand how my Peterman stock options are gonna work?
3	#	Just, very interesting.
3	#	(looks for George) Mmm. (can't see him) Oh, um, I got it.
3	#	It's PLO blend.
3	#	Ohh, I got your coffee.
3	#	(waving away) Nah, nah, it's on me. (looks at her watch) Aww, man. Okay, listen guys, I'm gonna be late. (taking her cup of coffee) I'll see you, okay? (begins to walk away)
3	#	Bye.
3	#	Yeah, Kramer, come on in.
3	#	(unsure) Oh-kay.
3	#	Ah.
3	#	(confused) Jimmy legs?
3	#	(grasping the concept) Ohh.
3	#	Tell her after sex, you just want her outta there?
3	#	I don't think so.
3	#	(interrupting) Yeah. I gotta be honest with you Kramer. You might be more than just a coupla tweaks away from a healthy relationship.
3	#	(pointing to the door, angry) Alright, get out.
3	#	(impatient) Get out!
3	#	This is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, George.
3	#	George, you didn't have to do this. I'm president of a big company. I can afford to buy you coffee.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Well, Mr Seinfeld, I..I'm not sure I understand why you want a job here.
3	#	Well, for one thing, you live in Florida.
3	#	(looking around her desk) Where is your resume?
3	#	Alright, Mr Seinfeld, I... What kind of position did you have in mind?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	(interrupting) Alright. Alright, alright. You come in tomorrow, we'll find something for you to do.
3	#	Uhm...
3	#	(stunned) Mr Peterman. You're back.
3	#	(hardly daring to ask) What about my stock options?
3	#	Well, we could fly some fabric in from our silk factories, for about a thousand dollars a bolt.
3	#	(tactful) It's, ah, Asian-Americans.
3	#	Don't worry, I...
3	#	Okay, Mr Seinfeld, this is not the t...
3	#	(worried) No, no. Well, I mean, you know, he's more like an intern, you know, at best.
3	#	So, if your parents move to Florida, you're poor.
3	#	Obviously. And if they stay, you're rich, but...
3	#	Quite a dilemma. You know, I have a bit of a dilemma of my own.
3	#	Alright, this is easy. Let 'em go.
3	#	Alright, well, then they stay. Lemma ask you something...
3	#	Speaking of Jerry, his father is driving me so crazy down at Peterman's.
3	#	What?
3	#	(puzzlement) Huh? What does that do?
3	#	(grabbing her bag and coat) I gotta split.
3	#	Mr Peterman, that can't have been the only time that you faced mortal danger.
3	#	One bright note in today's market, was the stock of retailer J Peterman, whose founder's surprise return generated a rise of twelve and a half points.'
3	#	(downcast) Yeah.
3	#	(sharp) What, are you sticking it to me?
3	#	I think you're sticking it to me.
3	#	(leaning forward and accusing) Stickin' it!
3	#	Really?
3	#	So, were your parents shocked to see the Cadillac?
3	#	Hmm.
3	#	Oh. (laughs) Ha-ha. Hey. Yeah, yeah. (indicating shelf) This Vincent guy, he is the best. He and I have the exact same taste in movies.
3	#	Gene? Oh, it's so stupid and mainstream.
3	#	(reading) 'The Other Side Of Darkness'. Huh, I never heard of that one.
3	#	(gets Kramer's point) Hah.
3	#	(emotional) Oh. Oh, bravo, Vincent. Bravo. (sniffs)
3	#	What?
3	#	Who is it?
3	#	Of Vincent's picks?
3	#	He musta got my number off the computer. We ended up talking for, like, two hours.
3	#	Trying to meet him. He's never at the video store. They said he sets his own hours.
3	#	(tossing the ball back) Yeah.
3	#	(laughing to Jerry) Oh god, that guy's terrible.
3	#	Hey, how come we played at this crummy place instead of your club?
3	#	Ah.
3	#	So he was bad. What d'you care?
3	#	The executor? Of what?
3	#	There's a feather in your cap.
3	#	Who's Reilly?
3	#	How 'bout this one? How 'bout, 'Your cranium called. It's got some space to rent.'?
3	#	Me?
3	#	(smiling, flattered) Oh, ho, c'mon.
3	#	Ach, I don't like the sound of this one.
3	#	Yank it like (pops open soda can) you're starting a mower.
3	#	Bore-ing.
3	#	I'd stick.
3	#	(points to Kramer and smiles in agreement) That's right.
3	#	Oh, this is the one Vincent told me about. The Pain And The Yearning. (reads from the box) 'An old woman experiences pain and yearning.' A hundred and ninety-two minutes?
3	#	You know, these movies are great, but they're just so emotionally exhausting.
3	#	Really?
3	#	(laughs) Huh. (looks from tape to tape) Well...
3	#	Yeah, I could use a chuckle.
3	#	What're you getting?
3	#	Oh. How much you got left?
3	#	(at TV screen) Bernie is dead, you moron! (frustration) Just because he's wearing sunglasses he looks alive?! (picks up video box) Ugh, how long is this weekend, anyway? (reads from label) Ugh!
3	#	Hello.
3	#	Vincent?
3	#	(defensive) No, it doesn't mean anything. I'm not even gonna rewind it.
3	#	Vincent?
3	#	What? Betrayed? Oh, Vincent, I'm so sorry. I...
3	#	Kramer, do you have any idea what you've done?
3	#	What're you doing?
3	#	Wha..wha...?
3	#	(upset) Well, how am I gonna know what movies to see?
3	#	(dismissive) Gene's trash.
3	#	(forcing a smile) Hi.
3	#	(handing Jerry an envelope) Look what came in the mail today.
3	#	It's the play button, off his VCR.
3	#	Ohio?
3	#	See, there are no jerk stores. It..it's just a little confusing, is all.
3	#	Hello.
3	#	(surprised) Vincent. (pleading) Where are you? I have to meet you.
3	#	Vincent, listen, I won't judge you the way everyone else does. You're, you're strange and beautiful, and sensitive. (blunter) Now, let's have a look at you.
3	#	Hello? Vincent?
3	#	I got what you asked.
3	#	W..well, can't I come in?
3	#	(pleading) No, no. Vincent, I... Don't shut me out. (beseeching) I just, I know you feel what I feel.
3	#	(confused) Uh, uhm, I'm, I'm here to see Vincent.
3	#	Ahh-cnee.
3	#	(sick smile) We have the same taste in movies.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	(to Jerry) Hi. (indicating Kramer) How's he doing?
3	#	Oh. (puts the VCR down) I thought a movie might cheer him up. I got him a Gene pick.
3	#	(evasive) I'm kinda off of him. (looking around) Uh, outlet?
3	#	Ah.
3	#	So, get this Mister Peterman is finally letting me do some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography. He's gonna let me ghost write it.
3	#	Hey!
3	#	What? What happened?
3	#	Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's personality)
3	#	Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) do you want to start with? Foreign intrigue? Exotic romances?
3	#	Oh.
3	#	Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..
3	#	get, um, started..
3	#	(After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book here.
3	#	You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place by the Van Buren Boys?
3	#	Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally flashed their secret gang sign.
3	#	But, that didn't happen to you.
3	#	No, I - I really don't think you can do that.
3	#	You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.
3	#	No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -
3	#	Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano story?!
3	#	What happened to Bob Saccamano?
3	#	Alright, well, now that's something..
3	#	(Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!
3	#	(Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing the pants you were returning?
3	#	(Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?
3	#	Alright, I think I got enough for one day.
3	#	(Mocking) Yeah, I'll chew on that.
3	#	Oh, thanks. I've got plans.
3	#	(Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?
3	#	(Sourly) I'll make a note of it.
3	#	You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.
3	#	You signed the release.
3	#	He sat in mud. Not you.
3	#	(Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!
3	#	It ever happened! Understand?
3	#	These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them) I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look, this is a list of things in his apartment!
3	#	How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?
3	#	Yes! I'm a writer.
3	#	Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!
3	#	What? Wheren't they just here?
3	#	Maybe we could all have dinner later?
3	#	How much did you pay for them?
3	#	Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?
3	#	Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into a side tunnel - and you run into a whole band of underground tunnel dwellers!
3	#	Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall in some mud, and.. ruin your pants?
3	#	No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a, as a reference?
3	#	Oh! These designs look great! Peggy, you really saved me.
3	#	(leaving with the drawings) Mr. Peterman is gonna love 'em.
3	#	You won't believe this but, as I'm leaving, she calls me "Susie."
3	#	What am I, a--a bulimic, chain-smoking, stenographer from Staten Island?
3	#	Someone I know.
3	#	I'd rather not say.
3	#	(to say hello) Mmm! What's in the bag?
3	#	Lithe.
3	#	(rolling her eyes) Lithe!
3	#	Well, you two'll have a great time there.
3	#	Mmm!
3	#	Backless? Ya gonna back her in?
3	#	She's not gonna twirl--
3	#	(coming in) Uh.. Hi, Peggy. Um.. Look, I should have said this yesterday, but--
3	#	Yeah. See that--
3	#	Well. Well, I thought she did a pretty good Job..
3	#	(testy, leans into Peggy's personal space) Look-it. It's not Suze. All right? It's Su-zie. My name, is Su-zie!
3	#	Can you believe this woman?
3	#	No. "Suze!" I mean, "Suzie!" "Suzanne!" "Suzanna." Fine! But there is no, way, I'm gonna be a Suze.
3	#	(tense) I mean--what am I--some pom-pom-wavin' Backseat Bimbo?!
3	#	Someone I know!
3	#	No, still Sharon!
3	#	Cheryl Miller's brother?
3	#	(same time as Jerry) --Wait, whoa--whoa--whoa--whoa!--
3	#	So that's it?
3	#	I didn't know Cheryl Miller's brother played basketball.
3	#	Mr. Peterman? You wanted to see me?
3	#	Su-sie?
3	#	(nit) It's Susie.
3	#	(dismayed) Ah, all o'--all of us?
3	#	(entering, uneasy) Mr. Peterman, Peggy, I.. guess we, should just get this over with. (sits)
3	#	Oh. No, we're not--
3	#	Look. (engaging smile) We don't have to name names, or, point fingers, or.. (breathes in) name names! (indicating empty chair) Me and her, have had our problems. She and I have had our problems! You and I, and she and you--
3	#	Yes! And I am convinced that if she were here with us today, she would agree with me, too.
3	#	(uh-oh) Her?
3	#	Ah--this is part of the problem!
3	#	(smiling, convincing) You're a, huuge part of the problem. But, I think that at it's core, this is a Susie-and-Elaine problem that requires, a Susie-and-Elaine solution! And, who better to do that than.. Elaine and Susie! Susie and Elaine!
3	#	(feigning hearing something) What?! Oh! Oh, I'm, coming! I--I gotta go. (rushes out!)
3	#	Well, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by such stupidity.
3	#	Do you hear something?
3	#	Jerry, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. They're starting to give Susie assignments now!
3	#	What?
3	#	I kinda like her.
3	#	Jerry--
3	#	(quiet) Oh, but I thought I was in line for that assignment.
3	#	All right, then, I was gonna wait, to tell ya this, but.. last night, Susie.. (difficult subject, quiet) she took her own Life..
3	#	(quiet) Look at this turnout.
3	#	(irritated) Your funeral's not gonna come close to this.
3	#	(quiet) Oh, oh--ho--I'm not Susie.. I'm Elaine.
3	#	Oh! Hadn't noticed! Excuse me. (she's going to the podium)
3	#	What can you say about a girl like Susie? (she doesn't know..)
3	#	And.. also, much like me, Susie hated going to the, Market.
3	#	Oh, god, yes, Mr. Peterman. (steps down)
3	#	Mr. Peterman.. (leaning forward, whispering) I'm Susie.. She's me..
3	#	(looks up, screaming in frustration!) Suuuuuuuuuuze!
3	#	Yeah, I'd like to place an order.
3	#	This Supreme Flounder, it says first time served in America. Is that true?
3	#	Forty-seven.
3	#	Uh, that's it.
3	#	Seventy-eight, West Eighty-sixth Street. Apartment three E.
3	#	I'm not below.
3	#	Your guy can't cross to my side?
3	#	Alright, fine. I'll just cross and meet him.
3	#	(using silly voice) Uh, yeah yeah. I'd like to place an order.
3	#	Oh. Oh, hi. China Panda?
3	#	I... thought that I would meet you halfway.
3	#	Oh yeah. (handing over money) There you go, keep the change. Bye now. I'll see you.
3	#	(at the boy's back) This isn't fair. This is address discrimination!
3	#	You still couldn't kiss her?
3	#	Oh, so now you're finding fault on a sub-atomic level.
3	#	Jer, do you see where this is going?
3	#	Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.
3	#	And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.
3	#	Shall we stop and say hi?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?
3	#	You see, there's this certain flounder and they won't deliver it to my side of the street.
3	#	No, I just need them to deliver it here and I have to be kinda inside is all.
3	#	No, actually I'm... I'm just kind of hungry.
3	#	Well, the lock was broken. You just have to jiggle it, actually. But, I just need like a half an hour to an hour.
3	#	She won't even give you a hint?
3	#	You know what I bet it is? (points) Your remote.
3	#	(walking to the couch) Or, could be your walkman there.
3	#	Yeah, I am.
3	#	How are you gonna widen the lanes?
3	#	(into phone) Yuh, I'd like an order of supreme flounder, number forty-seven. Yeah, apartment one-Q.
3	#	That's the janitor closet, across the street.
3	#	It's better than eating it alone in the restaurant, like some loser.
3	#	(heading to door) How do you know about it? You're not in the delivery zone.
3	#	Well, mine's coming in ten, so... see you boys.
3	#	Hi. Sorry, I didn't hear you. I was in the shower.
3	#	I'll see you.
3	#	Uhm, nothing. I was just uhm... I wasn't in there.
3	#	Right, because... I'm the janitor. (picks teeth with fingernail)
3	#	(meek) Yes ma'am.
3	#	Oh it's you.
3	#	No, it's not here yet. You want the tour?
3	#	(gesturing) There's this.
3	#	(gleeful) The fish!
3	#	Ah, what're you doing here?
3	#	Uh, man!
3	#	I'm plumb out.
3	#	(to the guys) Uh, Mrs Allister. (louder) Yeah, uh, just coming Mrs Allister. (to guys) Okay, I've gotta get out.
3	#	Here, can you move, you gotta move from the door.
3	#	Hi, I uhm... What can I do for you?
3	#	Yeah, I am so sorry.
3	#	Well, a lot of it is vegetable...
3	#	(meekly) Yes ma'am.
3	#	(to Mrs Allister) Janitor's meeting.
3	#	Hi.
3	#	Hi. Jerry, can I borrow your car?
3	#	I have to haul some dirty garbage to the dump.
3	#	Well, actually it's pretty grimy.
3	#	Well, I don't know who you are, but thanks for the car.
3	#	Bye.
3	#	Bye.
3	#	Hey, look at this. Wide lanes. This is so luxurious. Woo, yeah.
3	#	Where the cartoon candy's dancing and the Milk Dud's playing the banjo?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	The sax player?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	So?
3	#	HE's not gonna eat them. He's buying 'em for his Pepsi girlfriend.
3	#	He's a musician.
3	#	(indicating a movie poster) What about Sack Lunch?
3	#	Oh, c'mon Blaine. I mean, look at the poster for Sack Lunch.
3	#	(laughing) Don't you wanna know how they got in there?
3	#	(disappointment) Aww. Sold out.
3	#	So d'you think they got shrunk down, or is it just a giant sack?
3	#	(very dissatisfied) Why is everyone talking about "The English Patient, it's so romantic". (vehement) God, that movie stunk!
3	#	(firm) No you didn't.
3	#	How about, it sucked?
3	#	(aside) Huhh, getting the short end of that stick.
3	#	(handing over her money) Okay, one for Sack Lunch. (taking the ticket) It's good, right? (smiling) Yeah, good.
3	#	(surprise) Hey, what're you guys doing here?
3	#	They make it longer?
3	#	(shocked) Blaine!?
3	#	I thought you were busy tonight.
3	#	It's just a stupid movie.
3	#	(fierce) I will!
3	#	Ugh. You wouldn't believe it. My boyfriend dumped me. My friends, who I don't even like, they won't talk to me. (face-pulling) All because I don't like that stupid English Patient movie.
3	#	Oh, come on. Good? What was good about it? (scoffs) Those sex scenes! I mean, please! Gimme something I can use!
3	#	(calling after) Hey. You forgot about my piece of pie. Hello? (irritated) You know, sex in a tub. That doesn't work!
3	#	(hesitant) Well, uh, act..actually, I haven't seen it. So, I couldn't tell you whether I liked it, or whether it really sucked.
3	#	(shakes head) No.
3	#	(indifferent) Yuh.
3	#	(quiet vehemence) Oh. No. I can't do this any more. I can't. It's too long. (to the screen) Quit telling your stupid story, about the stupid desert, and just die already! (louder) Die!!
3	#	(shouts) I hate it!!
3	#	(shouts) Oh, go to hell!!
3	#	(grabbing her bag and coat) Great. I'll wait for you outside.
3	#	The only way I could talk him out of it was that I agreed to go and visit the Tunisian desert.
3	#	That's where they filmed the movie. It's supposed to inspire me.
3	#	I have to live in a cave.
3	#	(dread) No, no, no, no, no.
3	#	(cheering up) Ah, right! Aw, this is shaping up.
3	#	Oh, sure.
3	#	(uncomfortable) Ooh.
3	#	(annoyed) Aww, nuts!
3	#	Bye.
3	#	I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
3	#	Yes, his name is Hal.
3	#	It's the next best thing to being alone.
3	#	You are kidding.
3	#	Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that coming?
3	#	Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?
3	#	What exactly was that kid?
3	#	Well I don't care. It was delicious.
3	#	Wanna sit down?
3	#	Really?
3	#	Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back in ", or "Good Vertibrations".
3	#	Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?
3	#	Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?
3	#	I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of that guy.
3	#	He's got a back problem.
3	#	After one date!
3	#	Kitzmiller.
3	#	I don't know. Chuck it?
3	#	Oh, all right.
3	#	You have a water bed?
3	#	Well, what did you intend, Hal?
3	#	Custom designed?
3	#	Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
3	#	Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.
3	#	(on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All right, bye.
3	#	Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!
3	#	Jerry, Jerry.
3	#	What the hell is this? Where are you?
3	#	What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
3	#	Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my mattress.
3	#	How did you know?
3	#	Oh, GREAT!
3	#	Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.
3	#	Hi.
3	#	It is obtrusive, isn't it?
3	#	I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
3	#	I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  get going.
3	#	What smell?
3	#	No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other day and I forgot to hose off my boots.
3	#	Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.
3	#	Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
3	#	I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!
3	#	Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.
3	#	You feeling jiff?
3	#	Oh, baby.
3	#	I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, oh, okay, . . .
3	#	Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
3	#	I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.
3	#	Kramer.
3	#	I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get drunk the first night.
3	#	Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner called me.
3	#	What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months ago. She's already remarried.
3	#	Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)
3	#	Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.
3	#	How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? (They pause then look at each other)
3	#	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3	#	Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.
3	#	Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!" I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)
3	#	Why are you so concerned about this?
3	#	Hey, hey, hey!
3	#	Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.
3	#	Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?
3	#	Really.
3	#	Oh.
3	#	Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.
3	#	You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!
3	#	So what're you gonna do?
3	#	(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.
3	#	Thought it would be nice.
3	#	Hey, Arnie's just as upset.
3	#	(Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.
3	#	Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never heard from him again.
3	#	No, I mentioned the bisk.
3	#	Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, bleh bleh bleh....
3	#	Again you are telling me to shut up?
3	#	You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not getting the baby.
3	#	Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll make sure that it all gets worked out.
3	#	See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.
3	#	One little baby, whatever you have in stock.
3	#	Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun way.
3	#	Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
3	#	So they don't want a baby?
3	#	(Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George enters alone)
3	#	Nice looking family.
3	#	Where's Beth?
3	#	Uh, excuse me.
3	#	Uhm, I just have a question.
3	#	(walks up to counter) Helloo? I'd like to buy these hirachis.
3	#	(shouts) HEY!!
3	#	(tosses the hirachis onto the counter) Nothing. You, just lost a customer.
3	#	Alright, I have had it with those Mayans.
3	#	(unfolding chair) You know that store, Putumayo? (sits) I was trying to buy these hirachis, right, and the saleswoman just completely ignored me.
3	#	No, no, not Putumayo.
3	#	What'd you have?
3	#	Hey! See these? (raises her foot so her new hirachis can be seen) Cinqo de Mayo! Sales commission, bye-bye-o! (waves)
3	#	Shove it!
3	#	I got all this junk at Cinqo de Mayo, because I was trying to show Putumayo how much business they'd lost. I mean, I been dancing (demonstrates dance) and strutting in front of their store for two days.
3	#	Hey, you know what? Newman sent me an invitation already, to his party.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	No, no, no no, listen to me. I work in fashion. Together, we can drive Putumayo outta business and make Cinqo de Mayo numero uno... de Mayo.
3	#	(puzzled) You? What're you doing here?
3	#	No you don't. You own Putumayo. Unless you own both stores. (laughs nervously)
3	#	Ah, this really sticks in my craw.
3	#	(neutral) Okay.
3	#	(neutral) Fine.
3	#	(neutral) Alright.
3	#	(following Kramer to the door) Okay. Kramer, Kramer, wait a minute. Do you still have that pricing-gun?
3	#	Okay, I need you to help me put Putumayo outta business.
3	#	That place is about to have the sale of the century. Nothing over ninety-nine cents.
3	#	Come on, what is taking you so long?
3	#	Plan B? There is no plan B.
3	#	What?!
3	#	That's not gonna do anything.
3	#	Alright. Forget it!
3	#	You have screwed me again, Pennypacker!
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Where's Jerry?
3	#	No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
3	#	Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to you?
3	#	Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, I put them in the book anyway.
3	#	Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.
3	#	He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
3	#	Mr. Lippman, how are you?
3	#	What are you doing here?
3	#	Oh.
3	#	That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
3	#	Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.
3	#	"Top of the Muffin to you!"?
3	#	Mr Lippman?
3	#	This was my idea you stole my idea.
3	#	Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is my air and my idea.
3	#	Peach.
3	#	So? What do you want me to do about it?
3	#	Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you in that paper hat and that aprin...
3	#	Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the top, toss the stump. Taste.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.
3	#	And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"
3	#	Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.
3	#	Oh, hi.
3	#	You been enjoying them?
3	#	Well they're perfectly edible.
3	#	If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have to eat them.
3	#	Fine.
3	#	We were just trying to help.
3	#	I think I might.
3	#	Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.
3	#	Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?
3	#	You got any room on that thing?
3	#	Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll make it worth your while.
3	#	No they don't.
3	#	They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
3	#	In the back.
3	#	...and then Peterman ate it. I never told him.
3	#	Who's that?
3	#	Better call the zoo.
3	#	What?
3	#	It's like she's carrying invisible suitcases.
3	#	Yes, exactly.
3	#	Right. So why I'm the one who gets 'reer'. You know I mean they were being as catty as I was. It's a double standard.
3	#	That is so stupid.
3	#	You're going to the Tony's too?
3	#	How did you get that job?
3	#	Well, You might wanna think about...maybe, eh...moving your arms a little when you walk.
3	#	You know, sort of swing them, so your not lurching around like a caveman.
3	#	No no no no, it's just...
3	#	Sam, listen I'm so sorry about the other day.
3	#	See, yeah, that's all I was saying.
3	#	Well, you seem to be getting a hang of it...
3	#	This. My office. Sam trashed my office.
3	#	Mr. Petermen, this is not a cat fight. This is violent psychotic behavior directed at me all because are told her to swing her arms.
3	#	Do you mean "reer?"
3	#	Oh, no please Mr. Peterman, she's crazy! (Sam walks by and Elaine starts to sing) Crazy for feelings...
3	#	Jerry, that crazy straight-armed woman down at Peterman's trashed my office. And then listen to this; this is message she left me.
3	#	She must've got a blueprint of the building or something.
3	#	Well, I tried, but he thought it was some sort of cat fight.
3	#	Ok, why? Why do guys do this? What is so appealing to men about a cat fight?
3	#	Can't you do anything about this? I mean this woman is a psycho!
3	#	Look, just because I'm a woman...
3	#	Would you just keep an eye out for this woman. She's about ye high and eh, she doesn't swing her arms when she walks.
3	#	Like this...(imitates the walk with her arms hanging.)
3	#	Aren't you Raquel Welch?
3	#	Nothing, I wasn't just moving my arms...
3	#	Raquel Welch!
3	#	Yeah, I bumped in to her on the street. It got pretty ugly.
3	#	My god, George!
3	#	Wow, invitations again...
3	#	All right, well...you want to grab some coffee?
3	#	We have to break up.
3	#	I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is! And if you tell me what time it is in New York again, you are going home in a body bag!
3	#	Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are through!
3	#	Fine!
3	#	(to flight attendant) Hey, you gonna bust out that drink cart or what?
3	#	(to another passenger) Huh. You believing this?
3	#	You missed quite a performance.
3	#	(to passenger) Oh? You know my last boyfriend, he had a real kroner comprehension problem. Know what I mean? A real cement head.
3	#	(grabbing Puddy) What are you doing?
3	#	By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
3	#	This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
3	#	Well maybe I feel the same way.
3	#	Ok, so now what?
3	#	I can't believe we broke up like that.
3	#	Do you want something to read?
3	#	Well, are you going to take a nap or --
3	#	You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a seat?
3	#	That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing has changed. We've been back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
3	#	Oh, please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, Vegetable Lasagna here knows it.
3	#	Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and we just ram right into it and end this whole thing!
3	#	Jerry.
3	#	Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
3	#	It's Vegetable Lasagna.
3	#	Vegetable Lasagna!
3	#	Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
3	#	David, this has been the worst month of my life and if I never see you again it'll be too soon.
3	#	Oh that's origi-
3	#	86th and Broadway please.
3	#	Oh no.
3	#	Noooooooooooo!
3	#	Hey
3	#	Whats that?
3	#	Well, Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?
3	#	Tell me!
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	How is it talking?
3	#	Oh I gotta start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.
3	#	My Puddy? But we broke up.
3	#	Im doing great.
3	#	What?
3	#	David and I will not be getting back together.
3	#	What about you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.
3	#	You want to bet?
3	#	50
3	#	All right. Witness? (looks at George).
3	#	(doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o!
3	#	(looking VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.
3	#	(looking guiltier) No, nono.
3	#	(laughing).
3	#	Oh, you know I wear these shoes all the time.
3	#	Its the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?
3	#	Nothing, nothing.
3	#	(screams).
3	#	No! Its an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!
3	#	It was no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed a little dinner.
3	#	Ugh!
3	#	Hey!
3	#	No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?
3	#	I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).
3	#	See, this is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are back together.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Well, either way
3	#	David
3	#	Alright thats it! Were back together!
3	#	Oh, yeah.
3	#	Get those clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were going to cuddle.
3	#	You heard me. Strip!
3	#	Still?
3	#	Alright, here you go, choke on it (hands him money).
3	#	Yeah, well not for long. Im breaking up with him.
3	#	Double or nothing.
3	#	Alright, Im out of here.
3	#	I dont think so David, were through.
3	#	Whew that was a dozy.
3	#	Book it.
3	#	David I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is giving her a look like hes going to still get some).
3	#	Im going to get some popcorn.
3	#	So, how did it end?
3	#	uh.
3	#	Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?
3	#	See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.
3	#	Ah nuts!
3	#	Where are they goin'?
3	#	(Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin' Saturday night?
3	#	I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar Mitzvah.
3	#	(Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.
3	#	Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.
3	#	Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses Elaine)
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations to six more Bar Mitzvahs. (phone rings)
3	#	Where did that come from?
3	#	No.
3	#	So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.
3	#	Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.
3	#	I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.
3	#	No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.
3	#	(Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm.
3	#	Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.
3	#	Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.
3	#	Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her)
3	#	(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!
3	#	Did you and Patty just break up?
3	#	Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.
3	#	Whoa. What is the matter?
3	#	Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.
3	#	Oh my God. You're crying.
3	#	So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.
3	#	What?
3	#	I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?
3	#	Oh, that's insane.
3	#	I am not buying a computer from you.
3	#	(Pausing) Even so.
3	#	Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.
3	#	If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.
3	#	Oh, no. Don't!
3	#	Oy vey!
3	#	(Enters) Hey, what happened to you?
3	#	Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?
3	#	Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.
3	#	Do you have an apple or anything?
3	#	Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.
3	#	Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!
3	#	What?
3	#	Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.
3	#	(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!
3	#	No. Stay! Stay. Stay.
3	#	Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?
3	#	Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.
3	#	(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?
3	#	All right, Jerome, I'm in.
3	#	Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.
3	#	What? What happened to the new Jerry?
3	#	Oh, well that's just *great!*
3	#	Well, that's because you're an idiot.
3	#	Yeah...
3	#	I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.
3	#	Tomorrow evening, sure.
3	#	Do I know anyone??
3	#	Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?
3	#	I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.
3	#	You just left? What did you tell her?
3	#	I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.
3	#	Hey, working out?
3	#	Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.
3	#	No.
3	#	Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)
3	#	You? I'm more responsible than you are!
3	#	Kramer...
3	#	It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.
3	#	No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.
3	#	Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)
3	#	Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.)
3	#	I wish I was dead.
3	#	As long as you don't put...
3	#	Thanks for the re-fill.
3	#	Oh, he's...he's a joy...
3	#	Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.
3	#	It's not serious, is it?
3	#	Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.
3	#	It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.
3	#	Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.
3	#	I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.
3	#	No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!
3	#	All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)
3	#	Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
3	#	I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.
3	#	No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.
3	#	Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.
3	#	Vivian...
3	#	Hi! This is my friend George.
3	#	I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.
3	#	(whispering to George) You're up.
3	#	So how long did they drag you?
3	#	Hi George. Hi Jimmy.
3	#	Mmm. De-lish.
3	#	Delish. You know, short for delicious.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	(passing him the ketchup) Oh, sure.
3	#	(enters) Well, gentlemen. Lainie is... in love.
3	#	Hey, hey, hey! I met this guy! And it was like this, totally unreal, fairy tale moment.
3	#	Oh, George's friend. Whatever happened to him?
3	#	Oh, yeah... Puddy. Well, I won't fire him until I see if this new guy can... handle the workload.
3	#	Well, just tell him you want the SAAB.
3	#	Well, I have an idea. Keep the van, and get a bumper sticker that says, 'If this vans a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'.'
3	#	Okay, Jack. (to the cashier) Can I use your phone?
Elaine	#	(over the phone) Puddy? It's Elaine. We're through. Yeah, that's right. Again.
3	#	Hey, Jerry. I'd like you to meet someone. This is Jack. (Heraldic harp sounds as Jerry looks at Jack's face)
3	#	(enters) Hey.
3	#	Isn't he the best?
3	#	Oh, right now he's a fact checker for New York Magazine. It's not much, but it has a certain type of quiet dignity.
3	#	Oh, no.
3	#	Look, I'm sorry, Puddy. It-it was a mistake. So, let's just put it behind us, and we can continue like this never happened.
3	#	You're not taking me back?
3	#	He's not idiotic. He's the Wiz. And nobody beats him. Nobody...
3	#	So I told him, 'Hit the road. I'm going back with Jack.'
3	#	Really, what was the first?
3	#	What?
3	#	Well what, what about your fact-checking job?
3	#	Hey Walter, what is the deal with that guy?
3	#	(exhales)
3	#	You've been an enormous help.
3	#	Hey. What's going on?
3	#	No, Castro.
3	#	All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he just comes out of nowhere and he's right next to you!
3	#	That's right! He's a real sidler. (points at Jerry)
3	#	Wha-You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was sitting there making Cup-A-Soup singing that song from "The Lion King".
3	#	I thought I was alone.
3	#	Would you just, let it go?
3	#	Ehnn! This chair smells like garbage.
3	#	(giggles)
3	#	Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.
3	#	What? (with arms crossed, she turns quickly and )
3	#	Jerry. Oh there - -
3	#	(clears throat) (to Jerry) Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping my hide.
3	#	Well, he's getting credit for work that I did! He's gonna sidle me right out of a job.
3	#	Kramer, what is wrong with you?
3	#	Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards
3	#	(to Jerry) I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste of his own medicine, so, I am going to sidle, the sidler.
3	#	Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!
3	#	(winks and clicks) Thank you. ha ha ha ha. (sits down)
3	#	Well, I guess we'll just have - (Lou has left) Ohh, just gimme that. (takes the papers and walks away)
3	#	Yes, Lou. (exhales) You've got a lot going for you. You're um ... you're spontaneous. You're, symmetrical. You're, uh, ... (spins around as Lou is behind her now) Ehh - you're very quick, aren't ya. Um, It's just that your...
3	#	No. Your. (breathes)
3	#	Uuhhh.
3	#	Well, you should never ever go anywhere, (shakes a box of Tic Tacs) without these.
3	#	Hey! (startles Jerry and George) ha ha ha ha. Nice sidle, huh? Speaking, of which I think Ive got that problem, solved.
3	#	He's a human maraca.
3	#	You took him over to Celia's?
3	#	What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage of?
3	#	I think it's unconscionable.
3	#	EZ Bake oven?
3	#	Who wants cupcake?
3	#	Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
3	#	What?
3	#	No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!
3	#	No Mister Peterman.
3	#	(pushes Lou into the room) Lou! In here! (closes the door) We have to talk.
3	#	(Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou) Ooh, stop it! Bad voodoo. You gotta stop using these.
3	#	Because they're turning your teeth green?
3	#	O-kay ... well then your teeth are green for a different reason. You just gotta stop carrying these, okay? Just ... just mouth wash.
3	#	Binaca?
3	#	Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!
3	#	Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.
3	#	Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I-I know what a monster he can be. More wine and turkey?
3	#	Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for ya. (pours her glass of wine into Celias glass)
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.
3	#	I need some space.
3	#	I hate this.
3	#	No, I don't want this anymore.
3	#	I can't breath...I'm sorry...(Elaine wakes up) You're killing me!
3	#	(Banging the wall) Turn your alarm off!! (Screams)
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Yeah, that's pretty good.
3	#	Sara Sitarides?
3	#	Oh...(falls in to the sofa.)
3	#	You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that always smells like potatoes?
3	#	This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 330 this morning.
3	#	How do you do that?
3	#	I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)
3	#	I think I'll let you do it.
3	#	No, I really don't want to.
3	#	I thought you had done this before.
3	#	Well, how are we gonna do it?
3	#	Are you okay?
3	#	The cat.
3	#	Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.
3	#	What did he do about it?
3	#	Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.
3	#	Yeah, how's the doctor date?
3	#	Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.
3	#	Yes, she's a dermatologist.
3	#	Where are we going?
3	#	Can it cut that thin?
3	#	How did you know you cut it?
3	#	Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.
3	#	Alright, let's do it.
3	#	Come on, come on kitty...(slice disappears) ooh...how about that; it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?
3	#	Why not?
3	#	What do I have to know?
3	#	Right there.
3	#	Right there.
3	#	You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.
3	#	These heals are so uneven. (Watches the slicer.)
3	#	Pliers?
3	#	Got it.
3	#	I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.
3	#	Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.
3	#	Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.
3	#	Aha.
3	#	I don't know, I guess.
3	#	You have a little thing for this fella'?
3	#	Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.
3	#	Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.
3	#	Out, damn heal!
3	#	Kramer?
3	#	Just hold on!
3	#	Nothing...(heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.) Here, ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...
3	#	Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!
3	#	Oh, that's fantastic.
3	#	This is it. I can take this anymore.
3	#	Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I need someone to come over here right away!
3	#	I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!
3	#	Yeah, the address is 78th West...
3	#	Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.
3	#	Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.)
3	#	(Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.
3	#	I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the pain from her nose on the word 'about')
3	#	She.. was.
3	#	No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, and I - I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.
3	#	(To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all your fault!
3	#	(To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're still best friends, right?
3	#	(Whispering to Jerry) Hey.
3	#	What happened last night?
3	#	(Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
3	#	(Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking at his shoes) Are those Timberlands ... painted black?
3	#	(Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks toward the bride and groom)
3	#	(From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her head - apologizing)
3	#	Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to get married up here!
3	#	(Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.
3	#	Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina slept with him (Points to Jerry), he slept with me, I slept with Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all ancient history.
3	#	George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was acting so weird.
3	#	He schnapped me.
3	#	I can't tell you.
3	#	Okay. (Takes a drink and wave Jerry to lean in) I slept with the groom.
3	#	He used to be called Peter.
3	#	Sue Ellen! If she knew, she'd call off the whole wedding.
3	#	Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?
3	#	(Between laughs) Jugdish.
3	#	Hey, what if I got my, nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa! (sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor)
3	#	G'night, Jugdish. (Laughs)
3	#	Thank you...aah, hm mm.
3	#	Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What is that smell?
3	#	(Sees her enemy, Sue Ellen, at the airport) Oh boy. There's Sue Ellen. She didn't want me at this wedding, but here I am with a bunch of my idiot friends!
3	#	(Confused by her reaction) You are?
3	#	Come on, Sue Ellen. You don't wear a bra, you're tall... we hate each other!
3	#	(Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.
3	#	(Recognizing him) Peter?
3	#	(Acting equally strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange.. No. I..
3	#	Ooohh.
3	#	Oh please.. It's in the vault.
3	#	Hey, what time is it? (she looks up and asks as Jerry walks in the aisle)
3	#	Hey, what time is it?
3	#	Oh (quietly). Is this tooth chipped? (pointing to a tooth)
3	#	I have no idea.
3	#	Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth, flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her teeth. She is effected by that last drink) Oh.. God..
3	#	Oh, Mm mm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell you, any - more - things. (points at George)
3	#	Okey-dokey.
3	#	Heres your plane ticket.
3	#	Sue Ellen sends me an invitation, one week before her wedding in India. Tst, Ill show her...
3	#	Spite Never sleeps (doing a little dance as she says it
3	#	(Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with us tomorrow.
3	#	Three days.
3	#	You want to go to India?
3	#	Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.
3	#	I don't know. Nina. Nina! (Feeling she's said to much, she goes to leave) I'm gonna go grab a bite.
3	#	Well, Ahh, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.
3	#	I talked with the groom's parents..
3	#	... And it's so obvious that they don't want..
3	#	... me to go.
3	#	So, the only reason ...
3	#	... she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a gift.
3	#	Hi.
3	#	Bye-bye.
3	#	(Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?
3	#	You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?
3	#	Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.
3	#	(Confused) What combination?
3	#	Don't be ridiculous.
3	#	So what?
3	#	Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat?
3	#	Oh. Well, Usha.
3	#	(Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend, Sue Ellen Mischke.
3	#	Well ...
3	#	(Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I understand.
3	#	(Leaving) That's fantastic.
3	#	Hi.
3	#	You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. Invitation to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.
3	#	Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds up invitation) today.
3	#	It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher) Hey, are you gettin' taller?
3	#	Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..
3	#	What call?
3	#	(Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation girl. (Somewhat bitter toward Jerry) The one you think can replace me?
3	#	(Reading an invitation) India? Tst, Yeah, right. (Sarcastic) I'm goin' to India..
3	#	(Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go someplace else, Okay, Peter?
3	#	Hey!
3	#	(sitting down in the booth) 'Kay.
3	#	His apartment was being fumigated, so we thought we'd give it another shot.
3	#	So guess who called me last night? Jason Hanke.
3	#	He called to apologize for standing me up five years ago.
3	#	A.A. It's one of the Twelve Steps. Step number Nine is you have to apologize to anyone you've ever wronged.
3	#	What neck hole?
3	#	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
3	#	Well, it's funny. I mean, you have a big head. Or is it 'cause of your neck?
3	#	I really think it's the size of your neck.
3	#	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Isn't this great? With those nerds in accounting moved, you and I are the only ones who use this bathroom.
3	#	Ten minutes.
3	#	All right. Whiff away.
3	#	(holding Kramer off from getting another whiff) Hup! That's it.
3	#	So get this. I'm in the bathroom at work today, and I see Peggy using a seat protector.
3	#	So... we're the only women on the floor. I mean, we're like roommates. Would-would you use a seat protector if you had a roommate?
3	#	(eyeing Jerry meticulously cleaning up the soda) Yeah, you're probably right. She's probably one of those neurotic clean freaks.
3	#	(moving Peggy's water to make room for paper on the desk) These proofs look pretty good. Oh. Can I move this? Yup. I think this will work.
3	#	Peggy, we've got to talk. What is it about me that you find so offensive?
3	#	What!? I happen to have a very steady boyfriend. You know, I mean, we broke up a few times and there has been an occasional guy here or... or there, but, wh-why is this your business?
3	#	(leaving the room after rubbing Peggy's keyboard on her butt, sticking the stapler in her armpit, and coughing on her doorknob) Oh. All right. You think I've got germs? I'll give you some germs. How about some for your keyboard, huh? Huh? Oooh, how about for your stapler. Hmmm? That's good, isn't it? You have a happy and a healthy.
3	#	Oh, please.
3	#	Oh, come on, we all have intense malaise. Right?
3	#	Yeah, let me tell you something this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks I made her sick because I coughed on her doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her keyboard on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.
3	#	Chicken wing shoulder blades.
3	#	No, but that's one problem. Why?
3	#	Whoa! Walking around naked? Ahh... that is not a good look for a man.
3	#	Well, the female body is a... work of art. The male body is utilitarian, it's for gettin' around, like a jeep.
3	#	It's hideous. The hair, the... the lumpiness. It's simian.
3	#	Hmm. Sickies.
3	#	Hey, Puddy.
3	#	Balloon bouquet? For who?
3	#	Peggy. Oh, great. I suppose she's still blaming me?
3	#	I don't believe this woman.
3	#	She's this crazy woman who is convinced that my germs make her sick.
3	#	Huh?
3	#	What is this symbol?
3	#	Hey, I've had those since college. They're bunnies.
3	#	OK, we're broken up for the rest of the day.
3	#	(eating dinner with Kramer, Elaine, and Puddy) Mmm. This food is fantastic, PEGGY And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
3	#	Here's to Peggy, on her first week of being germ-free, free.
3	#	This food was in the shower with you?
3	#	Kramer.
3	#	So.. Whatley's still Jewish, huh?
3	#	(Shrugging it off) eh.
3	#	This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.
3	#	Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.
3	#	Mm-hmm.
3	#	(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)
3	#	Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons
3	#	Why don't I give you my phone number?
3	#	Hey!
3	#	(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later.
3	#	I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.
3	#	(Embarrassed) Free sub.
3	#	What?
3	#	What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus?
3	#	Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.
3	#	Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!
3	#	I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!
3	#	Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.
3	#	(Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free sub.
3	#	That's a good idea.
3	#	Worked?
3	#	Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time.
3	#	What were your.. demands?
3	#	I believe that's the new minimum wage.
3	#	So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.
3	#	So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number..
3	#	Ohh.. my..
3	#	My number? Ohh.. (looks at Kramer's business card) Okay.. Uh, well, there you go. (writes H&H's number down) And, uh, tell you what.. (looks at the board in the back) put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont.
3	#	Happy Festivus, Georgie.
3	#	Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.
3	#	Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now.
3	#	Maybe.
3	#	Hello, Frank.
3	#	Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest?
3	#	No, I got to stay here and wait for the call.
3	#	No, I just..
3	#	(Whining) I want the one that I earned. (Phone rings) I'll get it. I'll get it! (Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.
3	#	What did you do?
3	#	Oh, hi! (Waves at him)
3	#	Kramer, the vest just called.
3	#	Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.
3	#	(Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.
3	#	Steve.
3	#	It's Elaine.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?
3	#	No, no, no. You give me your number.
3	#	No.
3	#	No.
3	#	A fake number! Blimey!
3	#	I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?
3	#	What are you doing here?
3	#	Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.
3	#	(To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?
3	#	Hey.
3	#	(Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to celebrate his promotion.
3	#	(Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant.
3	#	I had the roast beef
3	#	(Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine is?
3	#	Oh. (Leaves for the room)
3	#	Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.
3	#	(Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting?
3	#	(Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring?
3	#	(Shrugging) I thought all guys do that.
3	#	Its that bad?
3	#	(Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten years ago?
3	#	Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the copy machine? Come.
3	#	Yay!
3	#	David, um, I..
3	#	Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is its very grease monkey.
3	#	Ah, I, Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.
3	#	(Sarcastically) Oh, that is really mature.
3	#	(Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.
3	#	Fine! Were through!
3	#	(While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind her back like he had done) On the flip side! (As Elaine is leaving, she mutters to herself) Takin me to Arbys
3	#	Hello?
3	#	(Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this?
3	#	What?!
3	#	(Sarcastically) You know, just that you cared enough to call means so much, Jerry.
3	#	Oh, I dont know..
3	#	Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?
3	#	And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout some lunch?
3	#	Ill hang this phone up right now!
3	#	Ill see ya. (Hanging up the phone)
3	#	Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.
3	#	Uh
3	#	(Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..
3	#	I guess.
3	#	What was that?
3	#	(While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah, well, thats not bad.
3	#	This is nice. What kind of car is this?
3	#	(To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?
3	#	So, George, I still dont understand - how was that a setup?
3	#	Very near.
3	#	Thank you. Ow!
3	#	I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
3	#	I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing that?
3	#	A fur?
3	#	A seemingly infinite supply.
3	#	Ow! Careful, it's hot.
3	#	He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.
3	#	Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.
3	#	We never dated in winter.
3	#	Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.
3	#	I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...
3	#	Why?
3	#	I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.
3	#	Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.
3	#	So, George... did you get the chair?
3	#	Hey, Joe Mayo.
3	#	Oh, fantastic.
3	#	Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.
3	#	Good working with you.
3	#	What?
3	#	Oh. Uhhh...
3	#	So Joe Mayo had the same coat.
3	#	Mm-hmm.
3	#	So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
3	#	No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.
3	#	But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.
3	#	So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.
3	#	Look at you. You're on a slant.
3	#	So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.
3	#	You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.
3	#	No. No. It's a small men's carryall.
3	#	It's not a purse. It's European.
3	#	Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?
3	#	If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a gift, too.
3	#	Did he get it?
3	#	Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.
3	#	Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.
3	#	What are you talking about?
3	#	88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
3	#	Come in, come in.
3	#	Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.
3	#	What?
3	#	Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.
3	#	You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.
3	#	Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.
3	#	Ha ha ha ha.
3	#	Uh, don't worry, he's cool.
3	#	Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?
3	#	All right, we're done here.
3	#	Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
3	#	Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.
3	#	No, that's not your coat.
3	#	It's Joe Mayo's coat.
3	#	Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.
3	#	What is that?
3	#	You ditched the fur?
3	#	You're gonna wear this all the time?
3	#	You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just give up . I have.
3	#	I don't remember, but it certainly wasn't this. Look at this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get this.
3	#	And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
3	#	Hey! George look at this.
3	#	You got it?
3	#	Come on, We're two intelligent people here. We can figure this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in an office.
3	#	The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".
3	#	It's a page number.
3	#	Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
3	#	We know what a face consists of.
3	#	Hi!
3	#	Jerry, She looks exactly like you.
3	#	Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.
3	#	Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this cartoon. I mean I don't understand why no one can explain it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
3	#	(to George who just came in) Hey! George, Janet looks very nice and she's quite a handsome woman.
3	#	Enjoy. (she leaves)
3	#	Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a little funnier,people won't be so quick to return the clothes ha ha....For example.. I..I really do....Well I love this one
3	#	Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that the animals enjoy reading the email?
3	#	Well you don't have to dissect if you can just tell me. Why this is suppose to be funny?
3	#	But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back to him)
3	#	No it isn't.
3	#	I don,t think so.
3	#	That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means do you?
3	#	Then why did you print it.
3	#	(gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears at a cocktail party talking about the stock market. You think you're doing comedy.
3	#	Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
3	#	She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got to go see this thing.
3	#	Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The New Yorker.
3	#	Yes, The New Yorker, I've met with their cartoon editor and I got him to admit that that cartoon ...MADE NO SENSE....
3	#	Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great gossip about James Thurber.
3	#	....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
3	#	I do to.
3	#	It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
3	#	Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.
3	#	That is not the point.
3	#	Just read it!
3	#	Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer stays silent).....What? It's funny.
3	#	And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha. See? that's his complaint.
3	#	Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
3	#	Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
3	#	I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's real.
3	#	I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks, The New Yorker. that's right. They're publishing it in their next issue. Oh! you know what I just ran into Newman in the hall and he said you tried to grope Sally Weaver.
3	#	The pig says "my wife is a slut."
3	#	Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny isn't it? (Dugan shrugs) Look at it, the pig wants to be taller and what's this guy gonna say?.. he he...Nothin'..he he.
3	#	Can I fix that after lunch sir?
3	#	(to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is funny and you want to know why? 'Cause I wrote it.
3	#	Oh! Do tell sir?
3	#	A Ziggy?
3	#	It must've seeped up my subconscious, Puddy has Ziggy bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?
3	#	Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on (Kramer turns around to leave)
3	#	Why are you yelling at the TV?
3	#	Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...
3	#	Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...
3	#	Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?
3	#	Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?
3	#	So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?
3	#	(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more)
3	#	I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...
3	#	I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.
3	#	Which one is he?
3	#	I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly)
3	#	And... what would those be?
3	#	Literally.
3	#	Oh!
3	#	Hey, what if he's married?
3	#	No, the Green Lantern.
3	#	Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.
3	#	So, how is a guy like you not involved?
3	#	(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.
3	#	Oh, that is so sweet.
3	#	(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?
3	#	Who is it?
3	#	(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)
3	#	(shouting up) Jerry! Jerry!
3	#	You didn't hear me buzzing?
3	#	Throw down your key.
3	#	I'll catch it!
3	#	...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?
3	#	Huh?
3	#	Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!
3	#	(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts)
3	#	Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)
3	#	Uh...
3	#	Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.
3	#	So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)
3	#	Oh.
3	#	Oh, that sounds... romantic.
3	#	(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)
3	#	Oh, sure.
3	#	(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.
3	#	This is his home?
3	#	So, he's...
3	#	He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth)
3	#	He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.
3	#	How can I end it over money? I feel bad.
3	#	Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.
3	#	Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.
3	#	Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?
3	#	If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.
3	#	Green Lantern.
3	#	(not amused) All right.
3	#	(annoyed) We get it. (George is laughing)
3	#	Thank you. (gets up from her seat)
3	#	(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)
3	#	(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?
3	#	(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke)
3	#	So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?
3	#	(giggling) Oh.
3	#	What are you doing? What is that?
3	#	It's garbage.
3	#	(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?
3	#	(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?
3	#	Make it three hundred.
3	#	(touched, she takes it) Aw, Glenn.
3	#	Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.
3	#	Who is this?
3	#	You're... poor AND married?
3	#	I guess I'm... Lois Loan.
3	#	Give me forty, you'll never see me again.
3	#	(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?
3	#	(entering Monk's with her boyfriend) Oh, um... Darryl. These are... people I know. Jerry, George.
3	#	OK.
3	#	Uh, I think his answering machine's broken, so I just gave up. Well, what do you think?
3	#	What black guy?
3	#	He is?
3	#	You think?
3	#	Nelson.
3	#	I think it's OK.
3	#	Is he black?
3	#	No, course not. I mean, I'd just like to know.
3	#	No, I don't need to know. I just think it would be nice if I knew.
3	#	(looking in her purse) Oh, here.
3	#	(as Darryl opens his door) Hey.
3	#	Great music.
3	#	Oh, wow, these are nice. Do they have any cultural significance?
3	#	Right. African.
3	#	South Africa.
3	#	Maybe.
3	#	So, George, do you have any thoughts on this Darryl situation?
3	#	Oh.
3	#	(rudely and giving him a 'duh' look) Because, if I ask him, then it's like I really want to know.
3	#	Is that the right word?
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.
3	#	I'll just talk to Jerry when he gets back. (seeing the Rosses entering Monk's) Oh. Mrs. Ross, Mr. Ross.
3	#	(laughing uproariously) The Hamptons? George Costanza? I, uh... I don't think so. Have a good one.
3	#	Yeah, yeah. Forget about all that. First thing is first. Warranty information. Name, we know that. Uh, hobbies. Skiing, racquetball...
3	#	It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Um. Oh, here's one race.
3	#	It certainly should be. It's nobody's damn business! But they really would like to know.
3	#	What?
3	#	laughing awkwardly Oh. Right. Good one.
3	#	Really?
3	#	No, but... it is very nice to know.
3	#	(in Jerry's apartment) Ah, I've given up. So, now we're going to a bunch of Spanish restaurants. I figure that'll cover us either way.
3	#	Hey, so Kramer's running for president of the condo?
3	#	Oh, heh heh heh. Who are they running against?
3	#	(to George) He's still down with his folks.
3	#	(to George) I'm gettin' his mail.
3	#	(to George) Mm-hmm.
3	#	(trying to understand what they're talking about) What?
3	#	Oh, right, at the coffee shop. Where did they get the idea that you have a place in the Hamptons?
3	#	What did you say?
3	#	I told them you didn't. And I laughed and I laughed.
3	#	But you lied first.
3	#	Like you're a liar!
3	#	So, this is over, not over? I'm bettin', not over.
3	#	Haven't you done enough to these people?
3	#	What?
3	#	Interracial? Us?
3	#	Yes, it's awful! They're upset because we're an interracial couple. That is racism!
3	#	Me neither. Well, maybe this turkey club.
3	#	(to the black waitress) Long day?
3	#	I hear ya, Sister.
3	#	(as Darryl comes into Monk's) Yeah. It's OK. My boyfriend's black. Here he is. See?
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	Aren't you?
3	#	You're black. You said we were an interracial couple.
3	#	I am?
3	#	No. Why would you think that?
3	#	That's because I thought you were black.
3	#	I don't think we should be talking about this.
3	#	I'm white.
3	#	I guess.
3	#	Yeah. So do you want to go to the Gap?
3	#	Yeah, yeah.
3	#	Goodbye?
3	#	Okay.
3	#	I won't.
3	#	Jesus?
3	#	Here's one. I borrowed Puddy's car and all the presets on his radio were Christian rock stations.
3	#	So, you think that Puddy actually believes in something?
3	#	Yes, he is lazy.
3	#	Yes, he is dumb.
3	#	Dumb and lazy, I understand.
3	#	How?
3	#	Quiet! So where is this Sophie?
3	#	How long have you two been together?
3	#	I needed to move a bureau.
3	#	Hello boys.
3	#	I did.
3	#	Ressurected! And look what I pried off of his bumper, a Jesus fish!
3	#	Well yeah, I got him because he seemed so one-dimensional, I feel misled.
3	#	"It's me?" Isn't it a little premature?
3	#	Hah. She's not a "me". I'm a "me".
3	#	That seems about right.
3	#	What was that?
3	#	So where do you wanna eat?
3	#	Arby's. Beef and cheese and do you believe in god?
3	#	Oh. So, you're pretty religious?
3	#	So is it a problem that I'm not really religious?
3	#	Why not?
3	#	Well I'm going to hell.
3	#	According to Puddy.
3	#	I'm not in the mood.
3	#	I know, but he does.
3	#	Well, relationships are very important to me.
3	#	Cause that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy, that's his.
3	#	Well if you want it, you get it.
3	#	Oh, but it's ok for me?
3	#	Alright, that is it! I can't live like this.
3	#	C'mon.
3	#	David, I'm going to hell! The worst place in the world! With devils and those caves and the ragged clothing! And the heat! My god, the heat! I mean, what do you think about all that?
3	#	Uh, you should be trying to save me!
3	#	I am not going to hell and if you think I'm going to hell, you should care that I'm going to hell even though I am not.
3	#	Yeah, that's right!
3	#	We're just, you know, having a good time.
3	#	Well, thank you father.
3	#	Oh, lighten up. It'll only feel like an eternity.
3	#	Maybe.. All over your face!
3	#	Hi, I'm miserable. (They both laugh)
3	#	Cocktail flu.
3	#	(Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. There was this guy, and we had a few too many..
3	#	Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going down!
3	#	(Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this is to someone in my position?
3	#	I am an associate.
3	#	Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
3	#	(Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.
3	#	(Sarcastic) Oh, bravo.
3	#	(Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?
3	#	"Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.
3	#	(Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..
3	#	Yeah.
3	#	(Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!
3	#	That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and I'm the office-
3	#	(Accepting) Alright.
3	#	Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.
3	#	French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George) Now, what is the problem with this book?
3	#	How much do you want for it?
3	#	(Confused) What is wrong with this book?
3	#	(Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs to the bathroom to wash her hands)
3	#	(Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little performance in the break room.
3	#	(Confused) Love newton?
3	#	An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!
3	#	Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!
3	#	Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-
3	#	Hey, it's me.
3	#	(Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?
3	#	My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.
3	#	Eat your soup!
3	#	Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you, away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits again - this time into the bucket) There you go, that's it. (To Jerry) You know what? I gotta go.
3	#	So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?
3	#	Great.
3	#	Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm the office hero.
3	#	(Leaving Jerry) See ya.
3	#	Uh, no, thanks.
3	#	You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. Every day is somebody's special day.
3	#	It's his birthday and it's his last day?
3	#	All right, pile it on.
3	#	It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?
3	#	I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
3	#	Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..
3	#	Your old high school hangout? Why?
3	#	Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?
3	#	Really? What're the other titles?
3	#	What is this?
3	#	Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating a sick day?
3	#	What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!
3	#	So how's it going with my friend?
3	#	Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 400 sugar rush.
3	#	I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.
3	#	Anybody here? Peterboy?
3	#	Ooh, it's a cake walk.
3	#	Mr. Peterman, um--
3	#	No, sir, I can't.
3	#	Guess what I ate.
3	#	No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.
3	#	A little stale.
3	#	Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
3	#	What is going on with you two?
3	#	400 sugar fix.
3	#	No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.
3	#	Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make a clean break.
3	#	Just a little off the side...
3	#	Well, no point in wasting $1,200.
3	#	I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
3	#	Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around for a while? Something prewar would be just great.
3	#	Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake that looks like this.
3	#	Do any of these look close?
3	#	Entenmann's? From the supermarket?
3	#	Oh, hello.
3	#	I guess I'll just--
3	#	Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?
3	#	Ohh...
3	#	Um...as far as I know.
3	#	Uh, I guess I hadn't--
3	#	Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
3	#	Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama or--
3	#	You know, Kenny Rogers has a-
3	#	Where did you get her?
3	#	Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?
3	#	Oh.
3	#	Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.
3	#	Downtown New York?
3	#	What? What is that?
3	#	I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
3	#	At work?
3	#	I don't have a fax machine.
3	#	Then maybe you have a fax machine.
3	#	Hello?
3	#	What?
3	#	Aah!
3	#	All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is a wise decision.
3	#	You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep with you.
3	#	What? A health plan?
3	#	Oh-ho-ho. Oh.
3	#	So you consider this a relationship?
3	#	Oh. Have you been out?
3	#	Where did you go?
3	#	Mm! To get what?
3	#	Cleaning supplies?
3	#	Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then chewin' some gum.
3	#	Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house every 30 seconds?
3	#	Which ones?
3	#	So this is never gonna stop?
3	#	You can pick 'em up right now.
3	#	Ahem. 646? What is this?
3	#	I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
3	#	No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.
3	#	You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.
3	#	No, I'm not. Here you go.
3	#	It's a new area code.
3	#	No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle number. It's the same.
3	#	Yeah? Well, so am I!
3	#	Oh, I'm so sorry.
3	#	A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone number?
3	#	Hey.
3	#	I hate the counter.
3	#	No. She died.
3	#	What did he say?
3	#	Oh, hi.
3	#	What?
3	#	Yes! 212.
3	#	Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?
3	#	All right! I am back in the game.
3	#	Hello?
3	#	No. You got the wrong number, kid.
3	#	Oh...nuts.
3	#	No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
3	#	Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
3	#	He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be to have a real family.
3	#	Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.
3	#	Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so good. I think Gammy might be dying. Yep. Yep. Ok. Good-bye, Bobby. Don't call anymore. I'm dead now. Gotta go.
3	#	Aah!
3	#	How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
3	#	Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting shellacked.
3	#	I thought you were hungry.
3	#	Watch out for that maroon Golf.
3	#	Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
3	#	Oh, all right.
3	#	Oh, yeah. What's that called?
3	#	Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let anyone through. We're never getting home.
3	#	I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down.
3	#	Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.
3	#	Huh?
3	#	You sure you want his face?
3	#	All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am going somewhere else.
3	#	I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya con dios.
3	#	Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it?
3	#	Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
3	#	Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here.
3	#	Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!
3	#	That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. Bye again.
3	#	Hey. Taxi! Taxi!
3	#	Jerry?!
3	#	Uh, well, uh, here--here is good.
3	#	Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't talk to me about hardship.
3	#	Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?
3	#	I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, but not anymore.
3	#	All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's a sniper lookin' to pop ya.
3	#	Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!
3	#	Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through here.
3	#	Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!
3	#	All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
3	#	Get in there!
3	#	Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real soon.
3	#	Well, I, for one, really respect that.
3	#	Come on, father, you can make it.
3	#	No! I won't!
3	#	All right. Take it easy.
3	#	All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy.
3	#	We should be able to get across right through here!
3	#	Oh, no! I thought--
3	#	Get a hold of yourself!
3	#	Sorry. Somebody...help us!
3	#	We're down here! Help!
3	#	Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
3	#	Help us up so we can cross the street?
3	#	But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
3	#	Oh, god! Let us out!
3	#	Hey.
3	#	Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind.
3	#	All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.
3	#	Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going to call you back.
3	#	What? No good?
3	#	Faux pas?
3	#	Why?
3	#	Here's a thought - Bye bye.
3	#	Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I'm sorry, I'm getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello?
3	#	Jerry, I'm on the other line.
3	#	I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the emergency?
3	#	That's the emergency?
3	#	I was on the other line talking to Jill.
3	#	You said it was an emergency.
3	#	So we can go anywhere we want?
3	#	Why are they doing this?
3	#	This is all very exciting.
3	#	Why Japan?
3	#	Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
3	#	It's not bleak - it's springtime.
3	#	You can't be bleak in spring.
3	#	What about Switzerland?
3	#	You're not going to do any walking.
3	#	So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
3	#	All right! You know what, just forget it!
3	#	I'll go to Paris.
3	#	Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call Jill one more time before we go.
3	#	Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?
3	#	All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.
3	#	Wow!
3	#	Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
3	#	Will you turn around?
3	#	You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
3	#	Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.
3	#	I don't know - it just is.
3	#	What is that?
3	#	What is that noise? What is that noise?
3	#	Oh my God!
3	#	What's going on?
3	#	Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!
3	#	What?
3	#	Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.
3	#	No no - me first.
3	#	Jerry, I've always loved ..u..
3	#	We're straightening out?
3	#	Okay.
3	#	Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane?
3	#	Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.
3	#	See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know? They can't really chase ya!
3	#	Forget it.
3	#	What? No, no - we didn't do anything.
3	#	The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
3	#	I know.
3	#	Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.
3	#	Oh, yeah.
3	#	What?
3	#	I guess we could've called for help.
3	#	Sure - the video.
3	#	What is that?
3	#	Good morning, Jackie.
3	#	How do I look, Jackie?
3	#	Thank you, Jackie.
3	#	Jackie says put it on, Jerry.
3	#	See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They can't really chase ya!
3	#	Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.
3	#	The Soup Nazi!
3	#	Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery.
3	#	You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!
3	#	Soup's not all that good anyway.
3	#	I thought he was deported.
3	#	I think so.
3	#	I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.
3	#	I've always loved ... United Airlines.
3	#	Puddy, don't wait for me.
3	#	Why don't you just blow it out your a...
3	#	If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?
3	#	Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts. You know, I-I looked in there and there he was having coffee and a donut.
4	#	Yeah. Joe DiMaggio.
4	#	Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.
4	#	Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Look I'm tellin-- (he does a double take and looks at George) I'm telling ya, that was Joe DiMaggio.
4	#	A stall man, huh? (small laugh)
4	#	Wha-ha-a-at? (makes a gesture with his hand)
4	#	Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him and I really watched him. I studied, his every move. For example, he dunks.
4	#	That's right.
4	#	Oh, he's a dunker.
4	#	And nothing diverts his attention. Like, I'm uh, you know, I-I, like I'm sitting in there, you know. And, uh, I start banging on the table, you know, to uh, so that hell look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the table) You know, *bang* He wouldn't move. So then I start doing these yelping noises. Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*. No reaction because the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on around him. See, that's how he played baseball. He dunks like he hits.
4	#	Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.
4	#	Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.
4	#	How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
4	#	Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
4	#	No no, he's fine.
4	#	Where?
4	#	Yeah -- yeah.
4	#	(quietly) yeah.
4	#	Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling Jerry, Elaine and George) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.
4	#	I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
4	#	No, blame me.
4	#	Don't blame me.
4	#	It was supposed to erupt.
4	#	You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.
4	#	When do you pit the sauce on?
4	#	I like to strain the sauce.
4	#	Yeah, Tina likes the couch.
4	#	(chuckles)
4	#	Yeah, it's a windshield.
4	#	I found it on the road.
4	#	Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.
4	#	wow
4	#	hell-oo
4	#	I, I saw her naked.
4	#	Well, you know, ... it was an accident.
4	#	I thought it was a closet.
4	#	Completely naked.
4	#	All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.
4	#	No, I want you to see me naked.
4	#	No, I want to show you.
4	#	Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.
4	#	You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in your head.
4	#	My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Listen uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.
4	#	Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.
4	#	So, is everything cool? or what?
4	#	Oh,
4	#	No, lets go to the couch...
4	#	Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?
4	#	All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.
4	#	Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.
4	#	I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.
4	#	Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video, watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.
4	#	Woah, you didn't like her?
4	#	How come you never said anything?
4	#	I tell you.
4	#	I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? Wouldn't respect myself.
4	#	Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back, every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I,ll, I'll do anything!
4	#	I went back with Ellen.
4	#	Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
4	#	From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you don't know me.
4	#	I'm getting my pot.
4	#	Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!
4	#	Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
4	#	Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
4	#	Well, ah you were right.
4	#	Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.
4	#	I'll bring back the pot.
4	#	Hey, what are you gonna see?
4	#	Hey, that's supposed to be great.
4	#	How do you know?
4	#	enters
4	#	What's the problem?
4	#	Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's going to be $50,000
4	#	If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000
4	#	Oh, memory burn.
4	#	How did they ever find you?
4	#	You know I never got a library card.
4	#	It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,
4	#	Yeah,
4	#	The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned up on that deal.
4	#	Tryin' to save a quarter.
4	#	Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ... Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding. She needs a little Kramer.
4	#	Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?
4	#	That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.
4	#	yeah
4	#	Ooh tattle tale
4	#	What did this guy do? What happened?
4	#	Oh come on, You can tell me.
4	#	What tonight?
4	#	Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
4	#	He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
4	#	Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. (TURNS TO LIBRARIAN) So uh, what's a guy got to do around here to get a library card?
4	#	Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library he's waiting for ya.
4	#	What's wrong?
4	#	So I, I didn't do anything wrong.
4	#	Why don't ya' leave?
4	#	Read another poem.
4	#	Wow, that is great. You should be published.
4	#	You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.
4	#	HELLO!
4	#	HELLO!
4	#	(reading) sobs
4	#	It's Marion's poetry. I can't take it (leaves sobbing)
4	#	You can have this one.
4	#	It's this way.
4	#	No, no, I got it.
4	#	If you like her, go talk to her.
4	#	She's fat.
4	#	I thought it was here.
4	#	Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one.
4	#	It looks familiar. I remember the elevator.
4	#	Dark blue.
4	#	Didn't we come in over there?
4	#	About two hours.
4	#	Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J
4	#	(CONT'D) Why? Nobody's around.
4	#	You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily.
4	#	Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry?
4	#	I'm gonna put it down behind that car.
4	#	(TO GEORGE) Pink eleven. Remember that.
4	#	Look at this place. It's huge...
4	#	It's got to be here.
4	#	I have a pen.
4	#	(RE CAR) I found it!
4	#	Oh...no.
4	#	It was easy the last time.
4	#	Right here at the mall.
4	#	You drank a whole bottle of water.
4	#	So why don't you just go?
4	#	Don't you get tired of following rules?
4	#	Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.
4	#	Buddy Hackett?
4	#	I know.
4	#	(pointing) You can go over here.
4	#	(turns away and spots George) George! (leaves scene)
4	#	It'll take you ten seconds.
4	#	(CALLING OUT) Jerry!
4	#	Does that bother you?
4	#	Not at all.
4	#	I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment.
4	#	The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds.
4	#	What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski?
4	#	He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave.
4	#	So go. GEORGE Here?
4	#	(SHAKING HIS HEAD) You and Jerry.
4	#	George! George!
4	#	Jerry?
4	#	Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was?
4	#	Right! Purple 23. I could've used you.
4	#	What time is it?
4	#	Well at least there's no traffic.
4	#	What time does that play start?
4	#	That might be a problem. (TO ELAINE) Where's your little bag of...
4	#	(CONT'D) Oh...(TAKES OUT PARKING STUB) Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here?
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Oh boy. Woop...
4	#	Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... (pats her on the shoulder twice.)
4	#	This guy leaves this jacket at my mother's house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.
4	#	Well, I'm not giving it back.
4	#	Well because I meet a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. I mean why do you think my mother went out with him?
4	#	Oh, gees...
4	#	You're all right
4	#	(eating some nachos) Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?
4	#	What?
4	#	No, it's statue.
4	#	Wait a minute, Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?
4	#	Oh, I really think you're wrong.
4	#	What test?
4	#	Hmm. Why you takin' an IQ test?
4	#	George?
4	#	Yeah, but why are you taking an IQ test for George?
4	#	What, is it for a job or something?
4	#	You're positive it's statute?
4	#	Hey, do me a favor... Some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.
4	#	No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.
4	#	Oh, he'll have to kill me. (leaves.)
4	#	Quiet. Shh, don't say anything.
4	#	Ah, well I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.
4	#	I thought you took the test.
4	#	How come?
4	#	Well, you can't leave now.
4	#	Never!
4	#	h-Yeah...
4	#	I'm going upstairs.
4	#	Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.
4	#	(to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.
4	#	You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there
4	#	Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)
4	#	All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)
4	#	C'mon it's my turn.
4	#	Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!!
4	#	Just be yourselves. ( Elaine plays with her hair flirtingly)
4	#	Well we're talking with Elaine Benes; Adult film star on the set of her new picture "Elaine does the Upper West side"
4	#	I'm doin' fine.
4	#	Whooooa! here's the director Jerry Seinfeld . Jerry , you discovered Elaine Benes?
4	#	So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?
4	#	That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?
4	#	So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?
4	#	(to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?
4	#	$15.90.?
4	#	What is that?
4	#	Naw ,na , that's no good.
4	#	Not bloody likely..
4	#	Wait,wait wait...Let me get the camera.
4	#	W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.
4	#	He's a happy camper huh?
4	#	Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.
4	#	My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud
4	#	He's in jail.
4	#	That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)
4	#	It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.
4	#	How often do you cut your toe nails?
4	#	cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle with my big toe.
4	#	What?
4	#	So , you blew it?
4	#	Let me have her number.
4	#	I know how to handle these psychotics.
4	#	(George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.
4	#	All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second.. I think I see something here George. Lets go to the videotape.
4	#	All right....Sit down George.
4	#	No, I got the tape right here.
4	#	(ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think, that I see. a couple of buds right here.
4	#	bout what?
4	#	Like the big toe captain..
4	#	Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)
4	#	I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape) Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.
4	#	Whoa!!!....That was you?
4	#	Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is you.
4	#	We'll order Chinese.
4	#	So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.
4	#	No no, he's never met her. She's in California.
4	#	Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.
4	#	Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.
4	#	Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at this club. Ohh, man.
4	#	Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.
4	#	What? What?
4	#	What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.
4	#	Well, I was just trying to help out.
4	#	You see what happens when you try to be nice?
4	#	(taking the paper and tearing it to pieces) I'm proud of you.
4	#	Well I don't, I'm guessing.
4	#	You got butchered.
4	#	(to a fleeing Audrey) Where are you going?
4	#	Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.
4	#	I don't have it, I threw it out.
4	#	I told you, I threw it out.
4	#	You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.
4	#	You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.
4	#	No, you told me not to!
4	#	Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you! Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror, cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!
4	#	(filling a pipe) Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got everything?
4	#	Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.
4	#	Because we're engaged.
4	#	Um hm.
4	#	(lighting his pipe) It's my mom's.
4	#	Yes, yes I am.
4	#	Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.
4	#	My contention?
4	#	Yes, that's my contention.
4	#	She does fine work.
4	#	You don't say?
4	#	So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
4	#	(rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder) Well, I'll check you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?
4	#	Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
4	#	Hey, how ya doing?
4	#	I'm sorry.
4	#	I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the window.
4	#	Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that the address was 8713 Riviera Drive. Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo. Finally, I hit it. 8173.
4	#	(to Elaine) You better zip up. I couldn't get the top on the convertible up.
4	#	Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.
4	#	The party, Long Island?
4	#	Hey, what are you doing here?
4	#	Where's Jerry?
4	#	Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything. (Sensing Steve's disappointment) Well, but I might have something.
4	#	So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them turned brown! Well I followed the instructions!
4	#	Not really.
4	#	(handing Steve the phone) 555-LOVE.
4	#	No, I got a girl in the next building
4	#	Who did?
4	#	Was it more than just one?
4	#	What are they gonna do?
4	#	Hello?
4	#	Kramer.
4	#	Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.
4	#	Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my building, it's 129 West 81st St.
4	#	Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.
4	#	He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been doing that for years, right Jerry?
4	#	You know I'm in that movie?
4	#	Yeah, I'm an extra.
4	#	Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked me.
4	#	Clear blue sky!
4	#	I got a quality.
4	#	Whoa, whoa!!
4	#	Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?
4	#	You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block carrying this bag of groceries.
4	#	So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and Woody, Woody starts laughing.
4	#	Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.
4	#	I got a line in the movie!
4	#	Pretty good, huh?
4	#	Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my hands, huh?
4	#	Uh, I didn't see him.
4	#	Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?
4	#	So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go, "Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."
4	#	No, no, I'm working on it.
4	#	No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.
4	#	I didn't say anything.
4	#	These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.
4	#	What happened here?
4	#	What's an extremity?
4	#	You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.
4	#	What about a big sponge?
4	#	Use a belt.
4	#	Yeah, I've seen them do that.
4	#	Maybe that's what he's got.
4	#	Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.
4	#	Can you give him a cookie?
4	#	I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.
4	#	Alright I'll get a blender.
4	#	You got a blender.
4	#	What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.
4	#	He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'
4	#	Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.
4	#	Hey, you seen the paper yet?
4	#	Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.
4	#	Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.
4	#	I got fired from the movie.
4	#	Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the glass down on the bar and it shattered.
4	#	Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.
4	#	Okay.
4	#	You can smell me without the drink.
4	#	Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?
4	#	All right.
4	#	That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.
4	#	Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.
4	#	Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...
4	#	What's that red dot on your sweater?
4	#	All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the F and switch for the N at Broadway Lafayette, or you can go over the bridge to DeKalb and catch the Q to Atlantic Avenue, then switch to the IRT 2, 3, 4 or 5, but don't get on the G. See that's very tempting, but you wind up on Smith and 9th street, then you got to get on the R.
4	#	Well, yeah...
4	#	Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Well, let's see speeding, running a red light, no license, no registration, no plates, no brake lights, no rear view mirror...yeah. (gives George a ticket)
4	#	I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me over six hundred bucks.
4	#	I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the matter with you?
4	#	Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.
4	#	Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna break his maiden.
4	#	Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats the slob. Born in the slob. His father was a mudda'.
4	#	His mudda' was a mudda'.
4	#	What did I just say?
4	#	Hey, all right, 600 Pappanick to win.
4	#	Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)
4	#	What happened?
4	#	Wait, wait, wait...
4	#	Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!
4	#	The *beach*!
4	#	I just joined the Polar Bear Club.
4	#	Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....
4	#	Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.
4	#	(looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?
4	#	Can I get in on that?
4	#	Is Elaine going?
4	#	Well, I knew him as well as she did.
4	#	So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?
4	#	You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just came home from the beach
4	#	Tell me about it!
4	#	I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
4	#	Break up with her
4	#	You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
4	#	Go ahead smell, smell
4	#	Do you recognize it? ... The beach.
4	#	Oh, I'm talking about the beach.
4	#	You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach? Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell. Oh yeah.
4	#	Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?
4	#	So you don't think it's a good idea?
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Is this the interference?
4	#	Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?
4	#	I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade over Marty Benson's head?
4	#	Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.
4	#	Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Did you hear about Martin?
4	#	I cant believe hes in a coma.
4	#	Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?
4	#	Newman! Hes good friends with him.
4	#	Hes got all of my attachments, you know.
4	#	What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?
4	#	So whats going on between you and Gina?
4	#	Uh, uh.
4	#	Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?
4	#	Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?
4	#	There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.
4	#	Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.
4	#	NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.
4	#	You should just eat fruit.
4	#	???
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Well, Newmans upstairs visiting Martin.
4	#	Youre not going?
4	#	Why not?
4	#	I dig.
4	#	I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going to kill me.
4	#	Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?
4	#	I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.
4	#	The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.
4	#	I wouldnt set foot in your house.
4	#	He looks happy to me.
4	#	Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. Hes not going.
4	#	oh oh oh oh oh
4	#	I want my vacuum cleaner!
4	#	Heey!
4	#	A couple of hours ago.
4	#	George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.
4	#	They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.
4	#	Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.
4	#	I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson
4	#	We played Backgammon in the nude.
4	#	Shes a sweet kid.
4	#	Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Whats this?
4	#	They moved in together?
4	#	Phew.
4	#	Hey, where ya going?
4	#	Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well be getting together.
4	#	OH! I got to call her back.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?
4	#	Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this, he gave me a gross.
4	#	Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.
4	#	Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.
4	#	Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!
4	#	Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!
4	#	Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?
4	#	Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.
4	#	Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.
4	#	Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.
4	#	Right.
4	#	Defective.
4	#	I didn't even know they were defective.
4	#	Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.
4	#	Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.
4	#	Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that guy. You two were hogging the ball.
4	#	You're a chucker.
4	#	Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.
4	#	Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?
4	#	Yeah, I snuck a peak.
4	#	Why not? hey what about you George?
4	#	Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.
4	#	Have a good one.
4	#	(loungingly talking on phone) It's a par five. So you know I step up to the tee and I hit a beautiful drive right down the middle of the fairway. I mean you know my hook, right?
4	#	well it's a dog leg left, so I play the hook right? .. hold on there's another call.
4	#	George?
4	#	(Angrily) Yeah, look I'm in the middle of something. Call back.
4	#	... so the ball takes of and I'm waiting for it to turn.
4	#	Yeah, I'll talk to Jerry. Yeah, [Hangs up] . . . you know that was Michael and Carol. She's wondering when we're going to come over and see the baby.
4	#	(does a double take) It's too busy
4	#	What guy?
4	#	Who are you talkin about?
4	#	KEITH HERNANDEZ?
4	#	I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.
4	#	Let me tell it ..
4	#	You always tell it ..
4	#	Ja ja ja - just tell it
4	#	Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.
4	#	He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"
4	#	Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left
4	#	Back and to the left
4	#	Wait, wait, (Exits)
4	#	It's Keith.
4	#	Hey
4	#	Okay, wanna come with me and see the baby?
4	#	Come on, if you don't see the baby now you're never gonna see it
4	#	All right
4	#	Yallo. What delay industries?
4	#	Na, you're way way way off.. Well, yeah that's the right number but this is an apartment
4	#	no problem, ... no problem. [Hangs up] ... How did YOU know who that was?
4	#	(to baby) Koochie koochie koochie koo
4	#	Lyndon Johnson.
4	#	I'm not joking. She looks like Lyndon Johnson.
4	#	I'll pick her up.
4	#	Well it was an accident. Right Jerry it was an accident. Ah, she's going to be all right. .. baby, baby, ah, baby.
4	#	What's going on?
4	#	What? Well, you hardly know the guy. What a nerve. You see wasn't I right about this guy? Didn't I tell you? Now, you're not going to do it are you?
4	#	YOU SAID YES!? Don't you have any pride or self respect? I mean, how can you prostitute yourself like this? I mean what are you going to do? You're going to start driving him to the airport?
4	#	yeah yeah
4	#	What?
4	#	I wish you never mentioned it to ME. [exits]
4	#	Ya know I hate to brag but, uh, I did win eleven straight golden gloves.
4	#	I wouldn't have brought it up but since you mentioned it.
4	#	Well I won them anyway.
4	#	Elaine. you don't know the first thing about first base.
4	#	The way I figure it I've already been there and I plan on rounding second tonight at around eleven o'clock.
4	#	Funny.
4	#	What's that?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Is that a problem?
4	#	He's got money. Why doesn't he just pay a mover?
4	#	Hello.
4	#	Oh, you don't remember me.
4	#	Yeah, you should. I certainly remember you. Let me refresh your memory.
4	#	Ah, you remember.
4	#	No no no, well, then who was it?
4	#	Well, maybe because we were sitting in the right field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
4	#	Oh boy. Uh, look uh, Keith, uh, we're sorry.
4	#	Wait, uh what are ya' doing?
4	#	Want any help?
4	#	I'd love to help you move.
4	#	No sweat.
4	#	Hey!
4	#	What, you took a cab?
4	#	How much do you make?
4	#	C'mon.
4	#	I'll tell you how much I make.
4	#	You ever seen Michael Jordan?
4	#	Maybe you'll see him do one of those three-sixty dunks.
4	#	Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	So what's going on, how did all this happen?
4	#	Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.
4	#	Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?
4	#	That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?
4	#	O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?
4	#	Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?
4	#	Who?
4	#	I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.
4	#	Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!
4	#	Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!
4	#	I can't believe I didn't see it.
4	#	You don't think so.
4	#	Maybe he's with the company.
4	#	The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.
4	#	That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.
4	#	What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!
4	#	Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.
4	#	O'Brien.
4	#	(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?
4	#	Yeah? Eva?
4	#	O'Brien? Well that's weird.
4	#	Hey! (Group does likewise)
4	#	What? What? What? Tell me.
4	#	Good for you! What kind of a sick lowlife would do a thing like that? You know those people, you know they're mentally disturbed. (Pointing a finger at Jerry)
4	#	They should be sent to Australia.
4	#	Yeah, yeah, that's where England used to send their convicts.
4	#	No.
4	#	Yeah?
4	#	I don't know!
4	#	You know I was watching Entertainment Tonight, and uh, suddenly I got dizzy. And the next thing I know I hit my head on the coffee table.
4	#	Yep. (Mumbles off)
4	#	Maybe it was a reaction to the sardines.
4	#	What happened?!
4	#	I think I hit my head again!
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	What?
4	#	Mary Hart!
4	#	Hey, you know who owns that car?
4	#	The one that was hit a couple of nights ago.
4	#	That blond across the street. You know the one with the long ponytail, she wears those blue sweatpants.
4	#	Wait, wait, wait, how do you know it's not John Tesh?
4	#	How could you?
4	#	Man! I never thought you were capable of this!
4	#	I just talked to Becky Gelke outside, she told me how you hit and ran.
4	#	I don't even want to look at you anymore! All these years of friendship and you're nothing but a felon. You're an embarrassment to the building.
4	#	Now you're not going to lie to me, are you?
4	#	Alright. Well. Glad we got that straightened out because I've got a date with her.
4	#	Yeah, going out with her Saturday night.
4	#	As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have even had an excuse to talk to her.
4	#	You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!
4	#	Well, why dont you take your clothes off?
4	#	(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.
4	#	Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.
4	#	She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.
4	#	Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).
4	#	Why, what's the difference?
4	#	Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.
4	#	Yeah!
4	#	George, you gonna buy a painting?
4	#	(immediately) Yeah.
4	#	Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!
4	#	(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,
4	#	(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!
4	#	Oh, hey.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Hey! Just wait a minute. We just got here!
4	#	(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.
4	#	Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (beat--holds up newspaper) Hey, we made the paper. Eh? Look at this- page 2, sports section... we're all in the picture.
4	#	A picture.
4	#	Uh-huh.
4	#	Yup, yup!
4	#	(entering, handing Jerry a piece of paper) This was in front of your door.
4	#	Hi, Mike.
4	#	(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!
4	#	(emotionally) She's deep.
4	#	You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!
4	#	(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!
4	#	(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!
4	#	...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.
4	#	Yeah, sure. Please.
4	#	Yeah. (beat) And, it was a big one.
4	#	Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.
4	#	Well you parked it on eighty-fourth and Columbus, right?
4	#	Yep, well I just walked by there and that car is gone.
4	#	Well, where is it?
4	#	Well, there's no difference, you know, I'm just curious.
4	#	What happened to the car?
4	#	Yeah, yeah, it'll kill me.
4	#	I must know.
4	#	Oh, come on.
4	#	Well, please?
4	#	Okay, I beg you.
4	#	Okay, please! Please tell me!
4	#	Okay, okay, what is it? Come on.
4	#	Ah, George, alright. Well, what for?
4	#	Alright.
4	#	Huh. I mean, what do they want to go there for?
4	#	You know, why didn't they ask me to go?
4	#	What, they don't like me?
4	#	If they like me, why don't they ask me to go? Oh yeah.
4	#	Well I'm very disappointed in George and Elaine. And you know I'm somebody you don't want to have on your bad side.
4	#	Because I'm like ice, buddy. When I don't like you, you've got problems. (notices some snacks on the table) Oh, is this for the fight?
4	#	Oh hey, you know I invited Mike Moffit. You don't mind, do you?
4	#	Yeah, I just got off the phone with him, you know we had a great conversation.
4	#	Well actually we talked about you. Yeah. He had some pretty interesting things to say.
4	#	You have to know everything, don't you?
4	#	Why is that? Why do you have to know everything?
4	#	Beg me.
4	#	No no no, I want you to beg me. And I don't want you to say it, I just want you to put some beg into it. Go on.
4	#	No no no, that's no good. No, I really don't think that's a beg. No, it's close, but uh...
4	#	Look, I can't say anything. You know, the guy told me the stuff in confidence, I'd be betraying a friend.
4	#	Alright. I'll tell you but you can't say anything to him.
4	#	He thinks you're a phony.
4	#	I told you, he thinks you're a phony.
4	#	A big phone. A big one.
4	#	You begged me.
4	#	(acting standoffish) Hello.
4	#	(out the window) Hey, Mike! Come on up, the fight's almost starting!
4	#	What's going on?!
4	#	I'll be down in a minute.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	(leaving) Why should anything be wrong?
4	#	Yeah, yeah, I know him.
4	#	I go in front first all the time.
4	#	By the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
4	#	Yeah, Jerry, he told me all about it.
4	#	You said it, sister.
4	#	I'm sorry, I don't care for that sorry.
4	#	Oh, congratulations.
4	#	Well, you're pregnant.
4	#	You're not pregnant?
4	#	Are you sure you're not pregnant?
4	#	That's weird.
4	#	I thought she was pregnant.
4	#	When can you park head first?
4	#	What about Sundays and holidays?
4	#	I'm not going if he's going.
4	#	No. Don't, Jerry.
4	#	He begged me.
4	#	Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo," and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.
4	#	It's just me.
4	#	Forgot the popper... (goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper, drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.)
4	#	What does it look like I'm doing? What?
4	#	Alright, alright...
4	#	Sorry.
4	#	My drain's all clogged up! (Comes out of the bathroom in a towel, covered in soap suds.)
4	#	Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.
4	#	What?
4	#	Oh, come on!
4	#	What, what, I thought you went to the movies!
4	#	Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
4	#	What point?
4	#	Just give me another chance!
4	#	I'm asking you!
4	#	You're joking.
4	#	It's not going to happen again!
4	#	No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of the keys."
4	#	I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.
4	#	I don't want the keys! (Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, but Kramer refuses.)
4	#	Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back.
4	#	That's right.
4	#	Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.
4	#	Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!
4	#	Well, you can get 'em back.
4	#	Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.
4	#	Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.
4	#	I yearn.
4	#	Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you yearned?
4	#	O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?
4	#	You got money?
4	#	Do you have a woman?
4	#	Do you have any prospects?
4	#	You got anything on the horizon?
4	#	Do you have any action at all?
4	#	Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the morning?
4	#	George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little boys.
4	#	I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.
4	#	No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.
4	#	I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you coming with me?
4	#	Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're key brothers now. (Gets up to leave.)
4	#	And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome young prince.
4	#	Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the cruel, cruel world.
4	#	Oh, he's cold.
4	#	Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me here!
4	#	Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.
4	#	What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' in Ivory liquid? (mimics choking somebody)
4	#	So, how long you been drivin' this thing?
4	#	Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.
4	#	You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.
4	#	Really?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.
4	#	Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.
4	#	Steven.
4	#	Oh - I'm familiar with it.
4	#	She was probably joking.
4	#	She didn't have any?
4	#	(raising hand) She faked 'em all.
4	#	Well so she faked 'em, so what?
4	#	You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
4	#	Yeah I could have helped you out.
4	#	I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons buddy.
4	#	Aaaaah.
4	#	Giddy-up.
4	#	You know, I faked it.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.
4	#	It's terrible!
4	#	Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.
4	#	You know what I'm gonna do? (heading for the door) I'm gonna return this.
4	#	Jerry this peach is sub par.
4	#	I want restitution.
4	#	Because it's no good.
4	#	It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.
4	#	So...
4	#	You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.
4	#	Oh now you don't want my business.
4	#	But what am I gonna do for fruit?
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?
4	#	Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
4	#	Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and uh well Joe doesn't want my business.
4	#	Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?
4	#	The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!
4	#	Alright look I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?
4	#	All right now here's the list. (hands Jerry the list)
4	#	I like mangos.
4	#	Well they gotta be soft.
4	#	Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
4	#	Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
4	#	Oh! And get some plantains. (grabs the list to write them down)
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
4	#	Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, (smells them) you did good George.
4	#	This mango is delicious!
4	#	I only got hundreds.
4	#	Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.
4	#	Come on, take some. It's good.
4	#	Ya.
4	#	Mmm.
4	#	Ya I told you.
4	#	Want some mango?
4	#	Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?
4	#	Well, move in here.
4	#	Why doesn't he just move in here?
4	#	You can move in with me, if you want.
4	#	Hello, Mrs. Costanza.
4	#	Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)
4	#	Yeah. (Exits)
4	#	Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
4	#	(Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?
4	#	Oh, I gotta go move the car. Alright (Leaves)
4	#	Yeah, well, that was a good one.
4	#	You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing business? She's a designer.
4	#	In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear.
4	#	Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..
4	#	(Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker. A moment passes)
4	#	Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's coat hooks)
4	#	Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)
4	#	What?!
4	#	(Laughing) But, it's only a toy!
4	#	A hand model?
4	#	(To George) Really? Let me see your hands.
4	#	Let's see.. (studies them) oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) masculine.
4	#	Yeah..
4	#	You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores..
4	#	Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit cover)
4	#	When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the cover)
4	#	Yea.
4	#	Yeah, yeah.
4	#	When we went to dinner the other night.
4	#	What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
4	#	(makes his pop sound) There you go.
4	#	Yes, yes! You said it!
4	#	(Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked you.
4	#	Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em.
4	#	Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate!
4	#	Yeah, come in.
4	#	Giddy-Up. (Stagehand leaves) Jerry! Five minutes!
4	#	Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the shirt) Aye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. (Walks around Jerry, inspecting the shirt) Look at it! It's fantastic!
4	#	(Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the (imitates a pirate) pirate look!
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Great.
4	#	It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what?
4	#	(To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you want to stop?
4	#	(Faint, trying to shut George up) Hey..
4	#	Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt.
4	#	You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished.
4	#	(Showing pure irony) I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray.
4	#	They gave them all to Goodwill.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Well I got it!
4	#	What do you think?
4	#	Well my buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
4	#	Good one? It's the Commando 8.
4	#	12,000 BTU's.
4	#	Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.
4	#	Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?
4	#	Yeah. (George enters the apartment wearing goggles) Yeah, rock on!
4	#	You know what you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical on Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.
4	#	Retail is for suckers.
4	#	You just gotta mention my name.
4	#	That's it. (smacks George on the forehead with a ruler)
4	#	The AC is on it's way.
4	#	What?
4	#	Well did you mention my name?
4	#	And?
4	#	Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.
4	#	Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!
4	#	Look, all you gotta to do, is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's it.
4	#	Right this way, mister Doody!
4	#	Hey, Dwayny.
4	#	What is going on here?
4	#	I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.
4	#	Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.
4	#	Remember this?
4	#	Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?
4	#	Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all *hopped* up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuffin' cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!
4	#	We'll see you Dwayne.
4	#	Commando 8 has arrived!
4	#	12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power. (Kramer places the air conditioner in the window) Installed!
4	#	No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry) I'll seal that up later, right?
4	#	Of what?
4	#	Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!
4	#	No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. (George's eating chips) May I have one of those, madam?
4	#	They're ladies' glasses.
4	#	Now look here, see it's right here Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.
4	#	She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious. (Elaine drinks some water and drools) She's foaming at the mouth!
4	#	(Singing) Oh myyyy papayaaaa. (The air conditioner wobbles) The air conditioner! (Kramer tries to keep it from falling by holding it's cord, but it snaps) I think it got the dog!
4	#	Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?
4	#	Jerry, he probably had a cold.
4	#	So, what are you saying?
4	#	Drugs? You think he's on drugs?
4	#	Jerry
4	#	Listen, we went in on a CD together.
4	#	And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.
4	#	Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?
4	#	I mean when he was leaving did he say "I'm splittin'"?
4	#	Whoh!
4	#	Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money back, right?
4	#	(grabbing the sweater) Yeah.
4	#	Anything new with that guy on drugs?
4	#	Then why the sniffing? Who walks around (sniff, sniff) sniffing?
4	#	South America?
4	#	Yyyeeaaah!!
4	#	Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!
4	#	Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!
4	#	Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.
4	#	What's today?
4	#	Really? Feels like Tuesday.
4	#	I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...
4	#	Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives...
4	#	Maybe I will.
4	#	Just gonna find out if he's interested.
4	#	All right, I'm going in.
4	#	I'll have a brewsky, Charlie.
4	#	Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?
4	#	Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then again, I've been known to do a lot of things. (Waiter opens the counter which hits Kramer on the head) Cigarette?
4	#	I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good all the time. (Kramer drinks the beer and smokes the cigarette at the same time. Barry sniffs) Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh fella?
4	#	Me neither.
4	#	South America?
4	#	Well that's a burgeoning continent.
4	#	Tell me about it.
4	#	I'm hip.
4	#	To the whole scene. (sniff)
4	#	The bathroom scene. (moves his knows as you would if you sniffed)
4	#	What ever turns you on.
4	#	Exclamation point.
4	#	Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.
4	#	Double exclamation point!
4	#	Hey, Ralph.
4	#	Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?
4	#	What's the matter? You've got a cold?
4	#	It's a sweater.
4	#	I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.
4	#	Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
4	#	Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.
4	#	All right, What about the money?
4	#	1937, 1937, 1937...
4	#	Uh ya, it's right around the corner there.
4	#	1937
4	#	Oh! God, It's a Pig man! A pig man!
4	#	Hey, I just saw a pig man! A pig man! Ya know he was sleeping and then he woke up and he looked up at me an-and he made this horrible sound, this (Quells like a pig).
4	#	I'm talking about the pig man. I went into the wrong room and there he was.
4	#	A pig-man. Half pig, half man!
4	#	A bris? You mean circumcision?
4	#	I would advise against that.
4	#	Ya well, so was uh sacrificing virgins to appease the gods, but we don't do that anymore.
4	#	I don't know.
4	#	They're all looking up.
4	#	Whoa. That's the guy that I told where the elevator was.
4	#	YEA!
4	#	Don't even question my instincts, because my instincts are honed. (REPAPER) Look at that.
4	#	Look look.
4	#	pig-man, baby. pig-man.
4	#	Hey, I'm tellin ya the pig-man is alive. The government has been experimenting with pig-men since the fifties.
4	#	Jerry wake up to reality. It's a military thing. They're probably creating a whole army of pig warriors.
4	#	You know, you should call this off, Elaine. It's a barbaric ritual.
4	#	It's a myth. Besides, it makes sex more pleasurable.
4	#	Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show you, and you'll never be the same.
4	#	Believe me, Jerry, somewhere in this hospital the anguished "oink" of pig-man cries out for help.
4	#	What?!
4	#	Wait wait George. You got room in the car for the pig-man huh?
4	#	George, if the pig-man had a car, he would give you a ride.
4	#	Be realistic George.
4	#	Yea.
4	#	Excuse me. What happened to the man, that was in this room before?
4	#	You know. (HE PUSHES HIS NOSE UP WITH HIS THUMB).
4	#	(STILL HOLDING HIS NOSE UP ) This doesn't look familiar to you?
4	#	Look, I know what's going on. The oink, oink.
4	#	(TOUGH TALKING) Now listen to me you little quack, There was a half man, half pig in that room over there. Now where is he?! Where is he?!
4	#	You know what I mean - pork, sausage, (A LA PORKY PIG) A-deek-a-deek-a- deek th-th-th-that's all folks.
4	#	He's lying.
4	#	Alright you go ahead.
4	#	We're not talking about a manicure. Imagine, this is going to be his first memory. Of his parents just standing there while some stranger (Does some motions of cutting; Myra sobs more) cutting off a piece of his manhood and then serves a catered lunch.
4	#	Me?
4	#	No, I'm not going to let this happen.
4	#	What about the baby?
4	#	Oh you'll be ok. I'll see you later.
4	#	(off screen) Outta My Way!
4	#	No.
4	#	NO, he's not.. Just a fat little mental patient.
4	#	(Leaving A LA GODFATHER) Don't ever go against the family Jerry.
4	#	Yes
4	#	Hey, hey, it's George.
4	#	And you're saying she's deaf.
4	#	Can't hear a thing.
4	#	And you're going to go out with her.
4	#	Hey I know how to sign.
4	#	Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able to do it in a while.
4	#	Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.
4	#	Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.
4	#	You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. I would love to be able to do that.
4	#	Well there ought to be ball men.
4	#	Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream. Elaine and Jerry laugh)
4	#	Hey, Georgie, I saw you on TV yesterday.
4	#	Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
4	#	Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they made a couple of cracks about you.
4	#	That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking about how funny you looked.
4	#	Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
4	#	It felt like 8 seconds.
4	#	Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
4	#	Excellent question.
4	#	All right, I'll see you later.
4	#	(while eating a banana) Hey Georgie.
4	#	I may be old, but I'm spry.
4	#	Oh I'll be up for it punk.
4	#	Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
4	#	Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls with such gusto.
4	#	-ca.
4	#	She doesn't know what she's talking about.
4	#	"Hi Gwen, hi tide."
4	#	Hi Todd.
4	#	"You've got something between your teeth"
4	#	No that's what he said. "That's interesting. I love carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea soup." So do I.
4	#	"Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."
4	#	"You want me to sleep with you?"
4	#	He says "I don't want to sleep alone." She says, oh boy, "love to."
4	#	"What? You're crazy."
4	#	"How?"
4	#	"... with a broom, cleaning up."
4	#	"Yes sweep."
4	#	George says "Cut it."
4	#	George is saying "Cut it."
4	#	What?
4	#	I know how to sign.
4	#	So, there were a lot of people there, huh?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Yeah, well, I told you to go in on it.
4	#	Well, I tasted it at the one downtown. It's got a remarkable texture. You'd never know it was non-fat.
4	#	Yeah, but did you tape it?
4	#	Yes!
4	#	Hey!
4	#	(sort of falling backwords) Yowm!
4	#	Well, you're getting heavy.
4	#	Yeah, you look like you put on (holds his hands out) five, (holds his hands wider) ten pounds.
4	#	I'll tell you something else, you're looking a little chunky yourself, buddy.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	I told ya.
4	#	No, no, no. That's hundred percent non-fat.
4	#	Well, maybe it's the Oreos.
4	#	You don't eat Oreos? (acts out eating Oreos) The way you break them open? You're (does a bunch of licking motions) ~ practically having sex with them.
4	#	You? You're getting old.
4	#	Oh, guess again, Tubby!
4	#	What?
4	#	Hey, I'll tell you what, Chubs, if that yogurt has fat in it, I will put myself on an all-yogurt diet for a week.
4	#	NNNN-Giddy-up!
4	#	Well, you can't have this tested now. It's melting.
4	#	It changes the molecules.
4	#	Hey, fatso! I got a 90 in biology.
4	#	Hello, there.
4	#	Ooh! Test tubes. Cool!
4	#	Well, the pleasure's all mine.
4	#	Why not?
4	#	I'm not taking her out just to influence the results.
4	#	Where's the lights. Whoa!
4	#	Yeah! Bunsen burner. (runs his fingers through the flame) oo ya ya.
4	#	Yaow.
4	#	You want a taste? It's Cappuccino.
4	#	I hear you.
4	#	Well, you tell me. Is the verdict in yet?
4	#	Well, this is in case there's a tie!
4	#	Hey! So, hear anything on the yogurt?
4	#	Well, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
4	#	No reason. Oh, did you hear about that Dinkins?
4	#	You didn't hear?
4	#	He's proposing a plan where everyone in the city should wear name tags.
4	#	Yeah! So people can go around saying "hello" to one another.
4	#	He's become the laughing stock! You know The Times has already stated it could cost him the election. (laughing) Name tags!
4	#	Yeow!
4	#	Huh, Okay.
4	#	Mine, too. I got one more day.
4	#	Yeah, me, too.
4	#	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Haircut.
4	#	I'm very happy with this.
4	#	Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
4	#	The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
4	#	You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's there all by himself.
4	#	What bachelor auction?
4	#	And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money to cure polio.
4	#	Polio?
4	#	What are you all dressed up for?
4	#	Yeah. How'd it go?
4	#	No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
4	#	So what?
4	#	His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying yourself.
4	#	I'm not going to let you. If you don't call him I will.
4	#	I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're going to get that haircut fixed up.
4	#	All right, geez. You're crazy.
4	#	It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
4	#	Yeah yeah yeah.
4	#	I'd like to have shoehorn hands.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix the haircut.
4	#	No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock.
4	#	I don't know.
4	#	Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive.
4	#	I told you he could do it.
4	#	Yeah, so?
4	#	No. He doesn't know.
4	#	Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a thing. Now come on. Pull yourself together.
4	#	What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
4	#	Do I think? He's repugnant.
4	#	Whatever it takes.
4	#	Equivalency.
4	#	(on the phone in Jerry's apartment) So when are you gonna be able to go out?
4	#	You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels)
4	#	I'll go.
4	#	Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again)
4	#	Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!
4	#	You don't know what you're missing buddy.
4	#	(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)
4	#	Oh... yeah...
4	#	Very... much...
4	#	What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking)
4	#	Wha--
4	#	Why?!
4	#	Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!
4	#	Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)
4	#	But why?
4	#	Ah!!! Yahh!!!
4	#	(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.
4	#	Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.
4	#	Are you kidding me?
4	#	Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.
4	#	Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.
4	#	Where's a phone?
4	#	Oh, God.
4	#	Jerry, I need another massage!
4	#	Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.
4	#	And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!
4	#	Oh I got the ball.
4	#	Well, It's quite a thrill.
4	#	Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.
4	#	What about my massage?
4	#	Egh. These aren't candies.
4	#	Well I'm a guest.
4	#	What, this is a party?
4	#	Whoah boy. There's always one at every party, huh?
4	#	Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what would make a great coffee table book? A coffee table book about coffee tables! Get it?
4	#	Alright, we'll take the subway.
4	#	Like a history of coffee tables, celebrities and their coffee tables. It's a natural. This is a story that must be told.
4	#	So, you're gonna talk to your boss about it, huh?
4	#	(claps hands) Yes indeed.
4	#	Oh, Queensboro Plaza. (reties his shoelaces) This stop is famous for its gyros, you want one?
4	#	Well, they got a stand right out on the platform. Gyros are cooked, and wrapped, and ready to go. (he pulls money from his pocket) Three dollars, no change. You want one?
4	#	Alright, but no bites.
4	#	(yells) Elaine!
4	#	I came by to get my ball.
4	#	Oh, yeah, thanks. (gets ball) Yeah, it's got the magic grip. How d'you think I bowled that two-twenty today, huh? (sees Indian) Yo! Where did this come from?
4	#	(unbelieving) I can have this?!
4	#	Oh. I'll lug.
4	#	(yells) Hey Jerry! (thumps cab door with his palm) Look what I got! (begins doing war-whoops)
4	#	Yeah uh, Elaine uh, what'd he say?
4	#	Your boss. Didn't you tell him about the coffee table book?
4	#	Yeah, you didn't tell him didya?
4	#	(simultaneous) Wait a minute, on the cover I'm...
4	#	Yeah, right, right, and on the cover is a built-in coaster. (clicks tongue) Alright, well I'm gonna go.
4	#	Well, I'm gonna go to the cigar stores. I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.
4	#	You know, I think it's worth something. It's kitschy. (tongue click)
4	#	I don't understand. How can you have a cigar store, without an Indian? It's unseemly.
4	#	Forget it.
4	#	Oh yeah, yeah.
4	#	Giddyup.
4	#	Pendant Publishing? Giddyup again.
4	#	Yeah, hi Elaine.
4	#	Ah, well, it's a business transaction.
4	#	Yeah, I'm sure it's all here. (puts in in his pocket) You know I was just admiring your coffee table, out there in the hall.
4	#	You mind if I use it in my book?
4	#	Well, I'm doing a coffee table book on coffee tables.
4	#	Uh huh.
4	#	Well, I'm still shopping it around.
4	#	Fungus.
4	#	I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
4	#	Big mistake.
4	#	Fungi.
4	#	Fungi.
4	#	Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.
4	#	Oh yeah.
4	#	Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.
4	#	Sister Roberta gave it to me.
4	#	I think she liked me.
4	#	Liked me.
4	#	No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
4	#	Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And I have no control over it.
4	#	Oh, that's my phone.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	I told you.
4	#	I told you she liked me.
4	#	Sister Roberta.
4	#	She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up all of these feelings inside of her. Shes questioning her faith. Shes thinking of leaving the church.
4	#	Oh, uh, this power. Im dangerous Jerry, Im very very dangerous.
4	#	(rushed) Yea, Hey. (Kramer enters.) Um, you wanted to see me Father?
4	#	I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. I just spoke to her innocently for just a few minutes. Its just that, that I have this power.

4	#	I don't know, we have a certain chemistry

4	#	No.

4	#	All right look, I am going to have to pay you back later. I don't have my wallet.
4	#	Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My Osteopath says that it's bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter. (makes a motion with his hips)

4	#	Ohh, it's real.
4	#	All right, all right.
4	#	You better be careful with that thing... You'll start a war.
4	#	(reading from the Penthouse Forum) "I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but every word of this story is true" (exits to street) " A few weeks ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive she thought our new neighbor Linda was"
4	#	Ahh.
4	#	"well of course I noticed it too with those cannibal breasts and pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock out." (turns the page)
4	#	No, no I can't comprehend it?
4	#	Well yeah, yeah. He could build the rocket, but-but he's still stupid for double-parking and blocking somebody in.
4	#	Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other hand he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?
4	#	How about Idi Amin, huh?

4	#	Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way and hit `em-----------(very over excited) into the ocean! Now picture this.... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and (he makes a golf stroke), that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then....... ..... gulp!
4	#	Yeah! (Kramer takes a huge imaginary swing)
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!
4	#	I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!
4	#	I have no concentration!
4	#	Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look theres still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!
4	#	Wha-- Oh, hey.
4	#	Oh, you liked it huh.
4	#	Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)
4	#	The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)
4	#	Yei-
4	#	Well come on George, finish the story.
4	#	Well then, what did you do next?
4	#	What is that a Titleist?
4	#	A hole in one eh.
4	#	(quietly) Um-hm.
4	#	(to George) What's with you?
4	#	Yep.
4	#	Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
4	#	Do it. Do it. This.
4	#	Oh yeah! It's you!
4	#	(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.
4	#	It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.
4	#	Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...
4	#	It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.
4	#	Real Boss!
4	#	(leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this?
4	#	Well, how did they get your face?
4	#	Hey, Elaine scratch my back.
4	#	Come on, one lap around.
4	#	It will be a funky adventure.
4	#	Jerry, how about you?
4	#	I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier)
4	#	Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.
4	#	Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and Jerry watch.)
4	#	Hey. These are for you Olive.
4	#	Ohh!
4	#	Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry throws out the spatula)
4	#	Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks.
4	#	You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.
4	#	Is that Elaine mannequin still there?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.
4	#	Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
4	#	What else?
4	#	What am I supposed to say?
4	#	I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
4	#	I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.
4	#	Uh, well, there's someone else.
4	#	Yeah, yeah, yeah...
4	#	Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
4	#	Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.
4	#	Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.
4	#	Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.
4	#	Hey!
4	#	What's doing?
4	#	Same old, same old.
4	#	Ya, Mickey. He hooked me up. We're stand-ins for the actors on 'All My Children.' Mickey, he's a stand-in for an eight year old kid and I stand in for the kids father.
4	#	(to Mickey) I told you, you should offer him some cigarettes.
4	#	(to Mickey) What about lifts?
4	#	Easy Mickey, easy.
4	#	Alright we gotta get back to the show. What are you guys doing?
4	#	(on his way to the door) Oh, oh well say hello for me.
4	#	Now look, we're going to stop at the shoe maker right now. You gotta get some lifts for your shoes.
4	#	You wanna keep your job don't you?
4	#	YAH! No Buts
4	#	(with his hand in Mickey's face) YAAAAAH!
4	#	Yo
4	#	(taps the Father on the shoulder) That's good work.
4	#	(trying to act like the guy playing the Father) I'm not really going away, I told you I'd be back every other weekend.
4	#	Now listen Porter, you know your mother and I love you very much. But sometimes people fall out of love. Now give me a big hug.
4	#	How do those lifts feel?
4	#	Ya.
4	#	Ooo she likes you buddy (they to a high five hand shake)
4	#	What?
4	#	Did you tell him the Packyderm story?
4	#	Maybe I outta go over there.
4	#	I'm very good with sick people. They love me. When my friend Len Nicodemo had the gout, I moved into his hospital room for three days, the doctors were amazed at his recovery.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	YAOH!
4	#	Hey, nobody put a gun to your head.

4	#	(whistles) What's he like huh?
4	#	Ya?
4	#	Hey. (to Elaine) Hey how was your date with Phil Titola?
4	#	Maybe uh, it needed some air. You know sometimes they need air, they can't breathe in there. It's in human.
4	#	I thought paper covered rock?
4	#	What beats rock?
4	#	Alright come on.
4	#	Rock.

4	#	Got to.
4	#	Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?
4	#	Why, why? Why does she get it?
4	#	"My wife has an inner ear infection."
4	#	I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?
4	#	C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!
4	#	Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married in ten years, we get hitched?
4	#	We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. (Kramer leaves.)
4	#	I take baths.
4	#	Got any coffee?
4	#	My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. (Frantic) I can't get into a zone!
4	#	Huh?
4	#	Oh, I forgot. (Hands back Jerry's can opener.)
4	#	Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.
4	#	Well, you gotta pick it up for me!
4	#	I'm so tired!
4	#	Huh? I don't?
4	#	Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! (The phone rings.)
4	#	Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you running here?
4	#	Alright, I'm gonna see you later.

4	#	Oh I'll take these.
4	#	Hey, remember this raincoat that you sold me?
4	#	Ya, you have any others?
4	#	Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint condition, would you be interested?
4	#	Cuz they're coming in from Florida as we speak.

4	#	Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' for dinner. Mmm the Paella was magnificent. Have you ever had really good Paella?

4	#	It was there!
4	#	Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so the book itself becomes a coffee table?
4	#	Danke schoen, my little dumplings.
4	#	Ooh, she's a package full of energy!
4	#	Yeah, and that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - she's brimmin' with positivity!
4	#	Great, I'm gonna bring Toby.
4	#	Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?
4	#	Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
4	#	Oh.
4	#	She's got a kid?
4	#	Hey, Jerry.
4	#	Well here's Toby, (points to Jerry in order to introduce him to Toby) Jerry.
4	#	What about me?
4	#	Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Look, she didn't mean anything.
4	#	She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!
4	#	Hey, what's going on?
4	#	What's happenin' here?
4	#	(going after Toby) Toby! Toby!
4	#	(voice; yelling) Toby! (Shot of a shocked Kramer is shown) Oh, Oh!
4	#	What did you go up there to heckle her for?
4	#	Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.
4	#	Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky toe.
4	#	Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.
4	#	No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe here, buddy - step on it."
4	#	Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize for ya, buddy - " (Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive uppercut) - knocked him out cold!
4	#	Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and now I'm drivin' the bus.
4	#	Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and I kicked him out the door you know with my foot, you know - at the next stop.
4	#	Well, people kept ringin' the bell!
4	#	Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place at the end of the line.
4	#	Well, it's a valuable appendage.
4	#	Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon as possible.
4	#	You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile on her face.
4	#	All right, get off at the next exit.
4	#	It's a great house, pool, sun deck? Yeah, I'll be there.
4	#	Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?
4	#	Put that on the top of your list.
4	#	What's that?
4	#	Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
4	#	Come on, I'll rub some on yours.
4	#	No. (George leaves for the tomatoes)
4	#	I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, you wanna come?
4	#	Yo yo ma.
4	#	We're gonna be right there.
4	#	Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
4	#	You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.
4	#	Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm goin' to the beach.
4	#	Oooh, lobsters.
4	#	Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!
4	#	Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.
4	#	I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows that 'damn' expression behind George)
4	#	Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.
4	#	I guess she was hot.
4	#	No, no, she got up, she walked around...
4	#	Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'll be right back.
4	#	Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?
4	#	You mean you've never tasted lobster?
4	#	Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when you die, you're gonna get some special attention.
4	#	No, I got 'em in the ocean.
4	#	Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all these lobsters came up.
4	#	Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for everyone.
4	#	Ahhh! (Shocked after seeing the baby)
4	#	You looking for this? (Holding up lobster)
4	#	Well, I thought you might wind up around here.
4	#	No I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
4	#	Well, that wouldn't be kosher.
4	#	Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.
4	#	Heyahhh!
4	#	Ya I didn't know you could cook.
4	#	Well I knew you'd regret it for the rest of your life.
4	#	Wonder what's goin' on.
4	#	Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!
4	#	The coffee table book. It's a go-oo!
4	#	You know what this means? I'm starting the book tour. First stop  Regis and Kathy Lee.
4	#	Oh, you better believe it!
4	#	No, no, no.
4	#	Well, coffee tables.
4	#	You know who you are? Even Steven
4	#	Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, uh Regis... actually, this is a true story. I umm I was skiing at the time.
4	#	Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You stay in school!
4	#	You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.
4	#	That's true. That's right.
4	#	Oh, it's on file, right here. (points to his head)
4	#	Hey boss.
4	#	How're you doin' there, big guy? (Puts his arm around the tobacco store Indian)
4	#	Al-righty (sits down) Have you got yourself a cold?
4	#	Woah, that's quite a honk!
4	#	Get yourself some vitamin C with rose hips and bioflavenoids.
4	#	Ya that was pretty good, huh?
4	#	Because of the coffee thing?
4	#	What about "Sonia Live"? Now you're not cancelling "Sonia Live"?
4	#	She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.
4	#	Oh, it's true.
4	#	Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to blow his nose? YEA!
4	#	Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than yours.
4	#	Nothin.'
4	#	What state?
4	#	They're never in contention.
4	#	Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.
4	#	Giddy-up!
4	#	No way!
4	#	Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.
4	#	That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.
4	#	Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)
4	#	If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?
4	#	This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.
4	#	Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.
4	#	Tape her breasts together. (Jerry is shocked.)
4	#	Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.
4	#	Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.
4	#	Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.
4	#	So, what's your talent?
4	#	Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
4	#	No, five. But you were close.
4	#	How's your evening?
4	#	Stop right there.
4	#	Disaster.
4	#	Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.
4	#	Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Oh, come on.
4	#	Oh, you're poo-pooing!
4	#	Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!
4	#	You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)
4	#	No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.
4	#	Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?
4	#	Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!
4	#	What is it?
4	#	How did this happen?
4	#	Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
4	#	Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!
4	#	Her birds are dead.
4	#	Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)
4	#	Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!
4	#	How ya feelin'?
4	#	There's nothing to be nervous about.
4	#	Poise. Poise!
4	#	That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.
4	#	Steve Gendason.
4	#	Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.
4	#	Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.
4	#	Ya, so I penalized him a stroke.
4	#	He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .
4	#	A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.
4	#	Turn on the TV.
4	#	I'm puttin it on
4	#	Jerry . . .
4	#	Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner.
4	#	Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.
4	#	A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.
4	#	Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.
4	#	Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well I don't have to tell you what happened.
4	#	You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?
4	#	Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.
4	#	Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.
4	#	Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.
4	#	Oh, I love curls.
4	#	All right, I'll see you later.
4	#	Genderson's.
4	#	It's weighing on my conscience.
4	#	Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back off.
4	#	My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!
4	#	I thought we would blend in.
4	#	we would have had all that bridge traffic.
4	#	Jerry, did you get my Fortune magazine in your mail?
4	#	(leafing through Jerry's mail) Oh, who sent you a card?
4	#	Open it, it's from Hallmark.
4	#	Let me see.
4	#	Did you ask her about me?
4	#	Giddy-up! Alright! So now, how does that work? Now, what, I get a percentage of every pledge I bring in, right?
4	#	Okay, yeah, alright, that sounds good, but I still get a tote bag though, right?
4	#	New cards, huh?
4	#	Oh. Well, I'll tell you, a nice greeting card can really lift a person's spirits.
4	#	(opening a card) Oh, a check.
4	#	There's a check in all these? Why don't you cash them?
4	#	But you got a whole pile here. 1987?
4	#	Jerry, your grandmother gave you this gift. She wants you to spend the money, to have the fun that she can't have. Oh, this is tantamount to a slap in the face.
4	#	Jerry, a gift not enjoyed is like a flower that doesn't blossom.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Huh? Yeah.
4	#	So you're bringing Danny Tartabull to the fundraiser tonight.
4	#	Yeah, I'd like to see the script too.
4	#	It would put me at ease.
4	#	Yeah, that's right. You did.
4	#	Oh, they were Chemical.
4	#	Hey, I didn't twist your arm.
4	#	Well, don't look at me.
4	#	My fault? Your Nana is missing because she's been passing those bum checks all over town and she finally pissed off the wrong people.
4	#	Any word from Nana?
4	#	Alright, alright. Look, Jerry, we gotta get down to PBS, PDQ.
4	#	Jerry, where are all the tote bags?
4	#	Well, I'm not leaving the premises without tote bags. I was promised tote bags and tote bags I shall have.
4	#	Who's that?
4	#	Jerry, I'll take care of it.
4	#	Well, he can't be disturbed now.
4	#	I'm sorry. I mean, I know what it's like to be in love. Ties you up in knots. And Jerry is a very sexy man.
4	#	Look, I'm not judging you. In fact, we here at PBS, we have many programs celebrating your lifestyle. Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City, Gender Bending and Swinging in San Francisco. Before Stonewall about those dark ages when you couldn't come out of the closet, lest you be persecuted because of your, you know.
4	#	(answering) PBS pledge drive.
4	#	Oh, you again. Buddy, look, forget about Jerry. It's not gonna happen.
4	#	Oh, uh, Nana. Hello.
4	#	As long as you've got your checkbook out, how about forking a little over to PBS? You watch the station, don't you? You don't want to be a freeloader.
4	#	Jerry? I have an announcement. Your grandmother is on the line.
4	#	And as we speak, she's generously writing PBS a check for fifteen hundred dollars!
4	#	Hi. I'm goin' through this stuff like water... (to Jerry) Who you talkin' to? (Jerry waves him away and moves towards the bedroom, still on the phone)
4	#	Oooo, ooooo. You know, I dig Asian women.
4	#	No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
4	#	No, no, n--Well, you know, I wore 'em for about a month but I couldn't stick with it. No, I need the secure packaging of Jockeys. (he's serious. Then he makes a hand gesture of grabbing up) My boys need a house!
4	#	Sperm count? Well how many ssssperm should I have?
4	#	Jerry. Did ya ever have your sperm count checked?
4	#	You ever get a woman pregnant?
4	#	What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
4	#	A LOT of 'em! (wild gesture, freaked out) Do you think maybe I'm... Depleted??!!
4	#	Yeah but what if I am? I'm the last... male Kramer! We're facing extinction!
4	#	Yeah, but then I'd have to... (glances at Elaine) well, you know... into a cup in the middle of the day??
4	#	Oh?
4	#	Yes! I would like to very much!... Well, I'm low, aren't I? I ca--I can feel it!...
4	#	Ohhh, maaan!! It's over! The Kramer name is finished! I'm never goin' to procreate--
4	#	What
4	#	All right, all right. What. What. You tell me; I'll do anything. Come on, Doc, tell me.
4	#	All the time?
4	#	Yeah, but I've always worn Jockeys.
4	#	Here, take my Jockey shorts.
4	#	Look, you gotta help me. I have to get off Jockey shorts.
4	#	Very low! Come on, Jerry. Take 'em.
4	#	Jerry, look! You gotta help me! I can't have 'em near me! If I have one pair in my house, I'm gonna wear them!
4	#	All it takes is one pair! Now, come on! J--
4	#	Boxers! How do you wear these things!! Look at that--they're baggin' up, they're rising in! An' there's nothing holding me in place! I'm flippin'! I'm floppin'!
4	#	What am I gonna do!? Jerry! I'm goin' CRAZY in these things! (leaves)
4	#	Oh, hey! Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up. I want you to put in a good word for me. (to Jerry) I've always had a thing for Noreen.
4	#	Well, if she's available now, I'm not gonna let her slip through my fingers this time. Nooope. (does a little dance)
4	#	Wellll, I wouldn't go as far as that.
4	#	Wrong again.
4	#	Oh, it be so. I'm out there, Jerry, an' I'm lllovin' every minute of it!!!
4	#	Surprisingly, no. I'm freee, I'm unfettered... (opens door to leave, still very happy, then) Feel like a naked innocent boy rrroamin' the countryside!! (exits)
4	#	Y'ello?
4	#	Elaine!
4	#	(pause) YEAHH!
4	#	Wellll, isn't it obvious?
4	#	Yes she is...
4	#	Oh, what? Am I... tooo boring for you?
4	#	Well, I feel that it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while...
4	#	That's right! She an' I have had a very long talk. An' I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life, lo these many years...
4	#	From now on, I'll be calling the shots around here...
4	#	Well. I've encouraged her to go back into the Army...(Noreen sighs a little) There she'll get the structure an' the discipline she needs right now... And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do...
4	#	Can't help ya, kid.
4	#	(triumphant) Hey, Jerry! Guess what! The Kramer name might live on! Noreen's late! She's laaate!! (give two thumbs up)
4	#	Hey! Couch is comin.'
4	#	Alright! Yeah. You know, I'm excited about this, Jerry. In a way, I feel like I'm getting a new couch.
4	#	Ooh! Remember Poppie?
4	#	Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?
4	#	It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?
4	#	Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the "old" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.
4	#	That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.
4	#	Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.
4	#	Did you offer those guys a drink?
4	#	What kind of a person are you?
4	#	Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.
4	#	Alright, what did you do to Poppie?
4	#	Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.
4	#	I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)
4	#	Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.
4	#	Why, what...?
4	#	Well, we're not very close.
4	#	Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.
4	#	Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)
4	#	Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?
4	#	Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?
4	#	What is what?
4	#	What puddle?
4	#	I don't know.
4	#	Are you sure?
4	#	I'm sure it'll come out.
4	#	Ah, you're making too much of it.
4	#	Right!
4	#	And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.)
4	#	It's cucumbers.
4	#	Well, why not? I like cucumbers.
4	#	But that's the idea, you make your own pie.
4	#	What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?
4	#	It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!
4	#	No, it isn't!
4	#	(enters apartment) Hey.
4	#	Hey, you got a hammer?
4	#	Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.
4	#	No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, you wanna take a ride?
4	#	(shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?
4	#	Oh, COME ON!
4	#	All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to leave)
4	#	A gymnast!
4	#	A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll melt your face.
4	#	(shuts door) "Bailing"?
4	#	Jerry, you should pay that price.
4	#	Ch- oo-... what?
4	#	(convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa.
4	#	(exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah...
4	#	Elaine?
4	#	Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh?
4	#	(rips open package) Yeah, that's...
4	#	(holds up framed picture) There she blows! (throws paper around)
4	#	Oh, these are nice corners, huh?
4	#	(looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. BIG computers.
4	#	Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!
4	#	Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...
4	#	Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right at you.
4	#	(pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!
4	#	Mama!
4	#	I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!
4	#	Hey.
4	#	I got a stone.
4	#	A kidney stone.
4	#	It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!
4	#	(enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into VCR, sets up TV)
4	#	Jerry, what is your problem?
4	#	All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?
4	#	Tantric yoga?
4	#	Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual delights that most men dare not dream of!
4	#	All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts playback)
4	#	Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
4	#	Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.
4	#	You mean like the uneven parallel bars?
4	#	(Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and I didn't make it.
4	#	(enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?
4	#	Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first time people are a little shy, a little reticent.
4	#	All right, where you going?
4	#	Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.
4	#	No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.
4	#	Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!
4	#	Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)
4	#	Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
4	#	Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.
4	#	Cause Im getting rid of it.
4	#	(claps hands) So ...
4	#	Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.
4	#	Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast.
4	#	What, you're giving him this suit?
4	#	Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)
4	#	Come on, try it on.
4	#	Come on, I want to see how it fits.
4	#	There you go.
4	#	Oh boy, that looks great. I can't believe you're giving him this.
4	#	He's very generous, isn't he?
4	#	No, you'll never get a better deal than that.
4	#	All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.
4	#	It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.
4	#	Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies.
4	#	Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal.
4	#	Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.
4	#	All right it's done.
4	#	(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.
4	#	She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Um, yeah. (glances around the apt.) Oh, uh ... well, how's everything? (clap)
4	#	Good, ah, (clap) what's going on?
4	#	Really.
4	#	It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)
4	#	Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things)
4	#	Uh, yeah, ah ...
4	#	There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...
4	#	Uh, Swiss.
4	#	H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry.
4	#	No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.
4	#	There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.
4	#	Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.
4	#	Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.
4	#	Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'
4	#	Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.
4	#	Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.
4	#	Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.
4	#	Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.
4	#	Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.
4	#	Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)
4	#	Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.
4	#	You said take 'em.
4	#	Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.
4	#	Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.
4	#	Well, why not?
4	#	C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)
4	#	Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?
4	#	Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.
4	#	Yeah?
4	#	Not necessarily.
4	#	Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	That's what I wanna know.
4	#	Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.
4	#	I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.
4	#	It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.
4	#	Apparently.
4	#	Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.)
4	#	Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)
4	#	No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?
4	#	Well, he was a little standoffish.
4	#	No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.
4	#	His tooth marks. He bit me.
4	#	No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.
4	#	That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!
4	#	Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.
4	#	You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?
4	#	That's right. He's a troublemaker.
4	#	He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.)
4	#	Not just someone. Jon Voight.
4	#	Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!
4	#	Those kids look pretty disappointed.
4	#	Where are they?
4	#	Let's go!
4	#	Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?
4	#	Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.
4	#	Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?
4	#	Good idea.
4	#	Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.
4	#	No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.
4	#	Ill meetcha down there, well have lunch.
4	#	Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ... (he looks and gestures out towards George and Jerry, as Elaine walks back into the bedroom to change out of the dress -- Kramer scratches his head in sort of disbelief)
4	#	You got a pen?
4	#	And I need something to write on.
4	#	I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Yeah well I don't have any time to talk now. (he rushes back into the theater)
4	#	I got it. Uma, Uma, Uma. (looking at the ticket)
4	#	Yeah, all right. Taxi's on me. (he walks off camera)
4	#	Well Elaine, when you're shopping on Madison Avenue, you don't want to skip on the, swank.
4	#	Huh, oh hey, look at this. (he pulls a little tube out of the bag) It's the super hydrating, triple-action moisturizer, hmm.
4	#	Wait till that Uma smells this Uva.
4	#	Hey Bania, what's happening? (Kramer, looking into the mirror, is putting moisturizer under his eyes)
4	#	Well, thank you.
4	#	No, this is vintage. They don't make this stuff anymore.
4	#	I sure am.
4	#	(interrupting Bania) That don't make you look high-waisted.
4	#	Me too.
4	#	Uh, 42.
4	#	make me an offer.
4	#	Surely you jest. (walks away from Bania)
4	#	Look at the stitching (takes the jacket off to show Bania) This is old world craftsmanship.
4	#	Sold. Follow me into the dressing room.
4	#	Bania, you're killing me.
4	#	There's nothing in there that I haven't seen before.
4	#	Psst. Hey.
4	#	Listen, I need you to get me some clothes.
4	#	Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.
4	#	What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.
4	#	Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.
4	#	[Yeah] (through the door)
4	#	Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?
4	#	Didnt Elaine call you?
4	#	Well what are you doing here?
4	#	Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants
4	#	Well, I sold them to Bania.
4	#	ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.
4	#	I told you I sold them to Bania.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Well, I didnt think ahead.
4	#	Bania?
4	#	Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.
4	#	Umas number is on that ticket.
4	#	Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.
4	#	What?
4	#	(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.
4	#	(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.
4	#	Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
4	#	Yeah, you're looking at the new Santa at Coleman's Department store.
4	#	On Prancer on Dasher, on Donna.
4	#	Donna!
4	#	Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. Don't be shy.
4	#	Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie dotchie do.
4	#	A dotchie cotchie dochie,
4	#	Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me.
4	#	A sweat shop.
4	#	Hey, hey, hey.
4	#	Hi
4	#	Oh, hey, hi buddy.
4	#	Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd out.
4	#	Woah, woah, come on.
4	#	Double?
4	#	You got that straight.
4	#	Talk to me baby.
4	#	Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
4	#	Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good combination.
4	#	There are no delicatessens under Communism.
4	#	Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. That's not right.
4	#	Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.
4	#	Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost.
4	#	You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys.
4	#	ho ho ho ho.
4	#	You can't fire me, I'm Santa Claus.
4	#	Yeah,
4	#	Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue.
4	#	I guess I screwed up!
4	#	I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is over I got to go to the airport.
4	#	Whoa, you're dating this woman?
4	#	George, you're becoming one of the gliterratti
4	#	Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.
4	#	Maybe she's bulimic
4	#	Bulimic,
4	#	Exactly
4	#	There you go monkey boy.
4	#	Here's your scrubber back.
4	#	Nothin'
4	#	Me?
4	#	No.
4	#	Well, now look, just leave me alone.
4	#	No, don't, don't make me
4	#	No, I can't, all right I can't ...
4	#	... My mother's a matron!
4	#	Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied? Anything else you want to know?
4	#	Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.
4	#	let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother in five years. We just don't see eye to eye. I don't even want to get into my childhood. I'm still carrying a lot of pain. A LOT of pain.
4	#	I can't I can't
4	#	(mumbles) b'd b'd
4	#	Ma?
4	#	What's so funny? ... wha?
4	#	All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a .. out of the bag.
4	#	Well you know all my life I've been running away from that name. That's why I wouldn't tell anybody. But I've been thinking about it. All this time I'm trying not to be me. I'm afraid to face who I was. But I'm Cosmo Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer. And that's who I'm going to be. From now on that's who I'm going to be. I'm Cosmo!
4	#	Hi Mr. Clotworthy
4	#	Ah couldn't be better. Hi Lorraine.
4	#	My mom Babs.
4	#	Yes, It's a fine day
4	#	Hey, everything my man.
4	#	You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that matron job.
4	#	Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're clean?
4	#	I've got plenty of ideas.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Thanks man.
4	#	Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.
4	#	Yeah
4	#	All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's
4	#	She quit.
4	#	Don't talk to me George, talk to her.
4	#	I don't know.
4	#	Ma!
4	#	Where can I put this?
4	#	It's Risk, Jerry. The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down) Alright, that's perfect.
4	#	The board, Jerry. We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.
4	#	We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.
4	#	Yes, yes. You're like Switzerland.
4	#	Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination. It's winner take all. People cannot be trusted.
4	#	Oh, I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
4	#	Alright, so you're gonna look after it?
4	#	Stay strong buddy.
4	#	Watch it good.
4	#	(entering) Hey.
4	#	Guess what? I saw Newman talking to the super.
4	#	The super has keys to your apartment. Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.
4	#	Yeah, alright, fine. You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world. But he'd be a horrible leader. And you know who's gonna suffer? The little people; you and George.
4	#	Oh. I talked to Arthur Jobanian. Yeah, the Drake's wedding? That's off.
4	#	The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl. So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	I'm watching your door.
4	#	Yeah, from my peephole. Fisheye, sees all.
4	#	Newman!
4	#	I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!
4	#	(rolling the dice) Yeah. I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
4	#	(running to the window) What?! Not my car!! Hey!! They're towing my car!!
4	#	I'm taking the board with me.
4	#	Oh, stop stalling. Come on.
4	#	Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland? I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.
4	#	Ha ha, the Ukraine. Do you know what the Ukraine is? It's a sitting duck. A road apple, Newman. The Ukraine is weak. It's feeble. I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
4	#	Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.
4	#	(to car as it accelerates away) Hey pig!
4	#	I was yelling at the litterbug. I mean this is my town. You don't throw trash on the streets of my town.
4	#	No, I fled the scene.
4	#	(to George) Hey buddy.
4	#	What?
4	#	Oh. What about?
4	#	Aw come on George, you can share it with me, huh?
4	#	You gonna share it with me next time, huh?
4	#	Aw, all right, I'm looking forward to it.
4	#	Hey. (to Elaine) Oh, I just saw your old boyfriend on TV.
4	#	Yeah. I really liked those glasses he was wearing. Where'd he get those.
4	#	I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.
4	#	Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?
4	#	Ah.
4	#	Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?
4	#	So you don't know where you got 'em?
4	#	Well, that's peculiar. (leaves)
4	#	...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.
4	#	Scared of being shot.
4	#	I like that eye patch.
4	#	(rising) Flat out refused! (walks past Jerry, who moves his legs)
4	#	Yeah, tell me about it, soul sister. (he opens the door to leave) Anyway, I told Jake that you said hi.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Well, it's uh, common courtesy.
4	#	(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!
4	#	(to Jerry) Hey buddy.
4	#	It's an eyepatch.
4	#	I wanna be a pirate.
4	#	(to Gary) How you doing?
4	#	Well, I tell you there's only one problem.
4	#	No. It's uh, (swaps patch to the other eye) it's itchy
4	#	What whip?
4	#	Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)
4	#	(looking after fleeing car) Newman! The white whale!
4	#	Just drive.
4	#	All right. Now you listen, and you listen good. I know who you are. You're the scofflaw.
4	#	(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.
4	#	You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.
4	#	Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?
4	#	So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?
4	#	All right, all right, I'm gonna help you.
4	#	Well, don't you worry, your honour. He's in my custody.
4	#	Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.
4	#	I think he looks fantastic.
4	#	No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.
4	#	You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.
4	#	No I think he's got you beat buddy.
4	#	Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.
4	#	No.
4	#	Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.
4	#	Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.
4	#	Yeah, yeah. I think he will.
4	#	Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.
4	#	Here you go brother. Some food for you.
4	#	Now are you going to be here in an hour?
4	#	Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?
4	#	Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.
4	#	All right George, come on, take a look.
4	#	Hey, man. Enjoy the food?
4	#	Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.
4	#	Woah, woah, that's mine.
4	#	No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.
4	#	I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.
4	#	Tupperware.
4	#	I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.
4	#	You must be kidding.
4	#	The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.
4	#	Oh yeah, you talked to her.
4	#	Yeah well we go way back.
4	#	Who's to say it didn't?
4	#	No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.
4	#	No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.
4	#	Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.
4	#	Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
4	#	Sure. I will.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Bald?
4	#	Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?
4	#	Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.
4	#	Me?
4	#	Hello, boys and girls.
4	#	Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.
4	#	Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby of our building.
4	#	So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna be a lot friendlier.
4	#	Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey, Carl!" and he says "Hey, Jerry!" You see, that's the kind of society I wanna live in.
4	#	(to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do you wear so much eye makeup?
4	#	(surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!
4	#	(evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing.
4	#	Oh, I, I need a pen.
4	#	Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough for you, buddy. And you too, Elaine, I haven't forgotten you.
4	#	You got that straight.
4	#	Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't have the problems we have in the world today. Well, you don't rob somebody, if you know their name!
4	#	Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate in my program.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Why?
4	#	Hey! Jerry!
4	#	I told you I was gonna get it.
4	#	(holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
4	#	Oh, hello.
4	#	(shaking hands) Yeah.
4	#	(points) You know, I really like that hairdo.
4	#	(interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. Nobody wears it like that.
4	#	No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.
4	#	Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
4	#	Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.
4	#	Hey...
4	#	...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah, you see?
4	#	(interested) Well, how do you do?
4	#	(keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
4	#	Hey.
4	#	For what?
4	#	You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world of loneliness and isolation. Now, you're part of a family.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	What's up?
4	#	Oh.
4	#	Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.
4	#	Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?
4	#	Hi.
4	#	What, again? You took one this morning.
4	#	I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment) Little problem.
4	#	(leaning to look round Kramer) Wendy here?
4	#	No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's terrible. No, we're done.
4	#	Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of those blue corn chips.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Hi.
4	#	Ooh, I like that.
4	#	Stefanie. 2-G.
4	#	Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you know.
4	#	So, you think your parents'll get back together?
4	#	Hey, George, stick 'em up.
4	#	For these German tourists. Pretend that I'm robbing you.
4	#	So these people can go back home and tell their friends they saw a real New York mugging. It'll give them a thrill.
4	#	Awright, hands up, porky!
4	#	That's it. Now, gimme your wallet. Got it in here, huh, fat boy!
4	#	(aggressive) Is that all you got?! Hah? Is that all you got?!
4	#	I'll tell you when it's enough! (he releases George) Alright, now you better not say anything, or I'll stalk you!
4	#	I'm Cosmo.
4	#	(little dance) One-two, cha-cha-cha.
4	#	(matter of fact) He had breasts.
4	#	No, not these. These were real hooters.
4	#	Well, maybe you're gonna get 'em too, George.
4	#	You know, Frank can't be too comfortable with those things clanging around. He should wear something for support.
4	#	A bra is for ladies. I'm talking about a support undergarment specifically designed for men.
4	#	I tell you, I'm gonna go noodle with this.
4	#	Hey. I uh, brought back your record player, huh.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	So, how you feeling?
4	#	Uh huh. Your back hurt?
4	#	Well, it's obvious, you know. You're carrying a lot of extra baggage up there.
4	#	Oh, yeah. Top floor. (sits beside Frank) Listen, Frank, have you ever considered wearing something for support? Now, look at this. (reaches into his pocket) Mind you, this is just a prototype.
4	#	No, no. A bra is for ladies.
4	#	Meet, the bro.
4	#	How's that feel?
4	#	You see?
4	#	Yeah, and your posture's a lot better. Look at you.
4	#	I told you! Now, Frank, listen. Here's what I'm thinking. Now, you have a friend in the bra business, right?
4	#	(claps his hands) Here's our chance. What d'you say? It'll be me, you and the bro, bro.
4	#	Why, what's wrong with bro?
4	#	Alright, you got something better?
4	#	Mansiere?
4	#	Now, it's called the bro.
4	#	Yeah, but I prefer the bro.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	(to Frank) I told you.
4	#	Uh.
4	#	Say you're getting intimate with a woman uh, you don't want her fumbling and struggling back there.
4	#	I think we've all experienced that.
4	#	(pointing at Farkus) Very funny.
4	#	Of course, yes.
4	#	I thought Jerry didn't want that couch, because of the stain?
4	#	Oh, you didn't notice? It has a pee-stain.
4	#	Oh, hey.
4	#	Awright, I got it.
4	#	Now, look. Somebody gave it to me.
4	#	The first upper-body support undergarment, specifically designed for men.
4	#	Oh, no, no. (demonstrates) Here, velcro.
4	#	"Jerry it's my fault .I couldn't make a shot. These losses they stay with me. They (?) Jerry. Now this is gonna plague me."( Puts on aftershave and cries out) OH! Mother!!!"
4	#	"What d'you got there?"
4	#	"Yeah"
4	#	"They're Plyometric.(sp?)"
4	#	"Yeah! They isolate the muscles. The muscle has to grow....or die."
4	#	"You should take cold showers."
4	#	"Well I take 'em........They give me a Whooooosh."
4	#	"So, you're heading home?"
4	#	"Ah! what.. Tim Whatley?
4	#	"Oh yeah.! I got a check up on Thursday."
4	#	"You know.. You really shouldn't brush 24 hours before seeing the dentist."
4	#	"Oh no, you got to eat before surgery, you need your strength."
4	#	"Hey!"
4	#	"What?"
4	#	" Hmm! Oh! Yeah. I'll tell you who is an attractive man; Gorge Will."
4	#	"Yeah! He has clean looks, scrubbed and shampooed and...."
4	#	"No, no I don't find him all that bright."
4	#	"So you got any cavities?"
4	#	"So what's wrong with that?
4	#	"So... Did you take a look?"
4	#	"Well I'll tell you I'm looking forward to my appointment on Thursday. I might even get there a few minutes early."
4	#	"Hey! What's this?"
4	#	"(gasp_)......Kom Pau........"

4	#	"He..he... When they pull that needle out I let the expletives fly."
4	#	"Well.. Aye can't hold the water."
4	#	"Hey Jimmy"
4	#	"Go Jimmy"
4	#	"HEY I'M DOING THE BEST I CAN!!!"
4	#	(cries out) WELL I SAID I'M SORRY."
4	#	"BUT I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING."
4	#	"HEY TAXI!!!.....TAXI!!"

4	#	"I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?"
4	#	"What kind?"
4	#	"There's no candy around here. hey! Jimmy."
4	#	"Whooo!"
4	#	"What!"
4	#	(Keamer's voice starts slurring again) "Yeah! My lips swollen?"
4	#	"No No I've been living alone a long time now."
4	#	"Hey! Got the new Penthouse"
4	#	" Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to tell you about an experience I recently had. As an avid reader I've always wondered if the letters (with Jerry) are I'm a dentist and one afternoon my hygienist and I decided to have a little fun with one of our patients. Of course none of our patients had any idea exactly of what we were up to. I was still wondering what if ......... (Jerry stops and seems bewildered)
4	#	Well, they're in...
4	#	The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!
4	#	Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year for this.. Oooh this is fantastic.. Makes your taste buds come alive....It's like having a circus in your mouth.....Take a taste
4	#	Come on ,Just take a taste
4	#	Come on JUST TASTE!!!
4	#	HE..YA. AYA. AYYYYYAAAAA!!!!
4	#	Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.
4	#	What?
4	#	Flea bites?
4	#	You got a dog?
4	#	Well, that is strange.
4	#	Don't sweat it buddy...I used to have fleas.
4	#	What do you mean?...
4	#	I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.
4	#	Toxic gas!!!
4	#	An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just couldn't put it down.
4	#	Now that you mention it , a little woozy.
4	#	I'm not going back in there!!
4	#	I left it on the coffee table or somethin'
4	#	Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in while you're with a girl.
4	#	Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...
4	#	Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get out of the building.
4	#	Oh! yeah.
4	#	Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled enthusiasm.
4	#	Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.
4	#	You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might say a cockeyed optimist, who got himself mixed up in the high stakes game of world diplomacy and international intrigue.
4	#	ah! Here we go.
4	#	May I..( pointing her food)
4	#	what is this?
4	#	I can't taste this.
4	#	This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...( realizes) It must be the toxic gas from the fumigation......( he leaves paranoid and confused)
4	#	Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..
4	#	Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin' , Can't even taste a Macanaw.
4	#	Waited all year and I can't even taste it..
4	#	ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a passerby) Hey! What's the date today?
4	#	Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still make it. Wait.. Newman...
4	#	( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember the mailman don't you.
4	#	Hi, little buddy.
4	#	Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.
4	#	All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)
4	#	Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.
4	#	So, who is your doctor?
4	#	(whistles). He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this kid from Guatemala with no nose. Turned him into Ricardo Montalban.
4	#	Tuesday? Uh...
4	#	Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until I go down to the motor vehicle bureau and get my new plates.
4	#	Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. Cosmo Kramer.
4	#	All righty...
4	#	(signs it) Okay. (The clerk hands him a manila envelope). Thanks. (opens up the envelope) Assman? Oh, no, these don't belong to me. I'm not the Assman. I think there's been a mistake.
4	#	Cosmo Kramer.
4	#	No! I'm not the Assman.
4	#	Here you go, buddy. (shows it to Jerry).
4	#	*Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the microphone?
4	#	In my spare time. (turns to George). You know, I'm working on one of you, George. I'm using ravioli. See, the hard part is to find a pasta that captures the individual.
4	#	Because *you're* silly. Get it? (hands the Fusilli to Jerry) Yeah...
4	#	Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. Somebody got mine and I got their *vanity* plates.
4	#	Assman.
4	#	Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!
4	#	Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.
4	#	Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually have a very good sense of humor. You meet a proctologist at a party, don't walk away. *Plant* yourself there, because you will hear the funniest stories you've ever heard. See, no one wants to admit to them that they *stuck* something up there. Never! It's always an accident. Every proctologist story ends in the same way "It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
4	#	Oh! There's my phone. (He leaves)
4	#	"Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think I have what you're looking for." (Pleased by the note, Kramer stumbles into his car).
4	#	Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. (points to plate) Proctology.
4	#	Thanks. Have a good day.
4	#	I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
4	#	Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.
4	#	Oh, yeah.
4	#	You got that straight!
4	#	Hey, well, this is Sally.
4	#	Shall we go?
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Hey, Frank.
4	#	C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking about.
4	#	Bro.
4	#	Bro!
4	#	Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.
4	#	The name on the boat. Look at it.
4	#	Yeah (points towards the doctor's office), he's the Assman! Jerry, *he's* the Assman!
4	#	Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently get the wrong license plates?
4	#	So...you're the Assman.
4	#	Hey, how you doin'?
4	#	Name's Kramer.
4	#	Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute they're arriving.
4	#	Bet? Um, not betting.
4	#	I haven't made a bet in three years, I-
4	#	Okay, how much?
4	#	You're on, cowboy!
4	#	C'mon Seattle, let's go.
4	#	Seattle, yeah!
4	#	All right, c'mon, let's go again.
4	#	All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.
4	#	All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)
4	#	Yeah, it's, uh, me.
4	#	All right, listen. I need some cash.
4	#	I just need it, that's all.
4	#	I'm at the airport.
4	#	We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.
4	#	Sure you do.
4	#	Oh help me man, I'm desperate!
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Good. (To Earl) Here's my collateral.
4	#	Yeah, don't I know it.
4	#	All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?
4	#	Double or nothin'.
4	#	Yeah, he was.
4	#	Oh I accept.
4	#	Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like yourself. (Elaine enters)
4	#	Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
4	#	Boy...
4	#	C'mon!
4	#	What?
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Oh, I'm there, Monongahela!
4	#	So, so.
4	#	She must be a very special lady, huh George, yeah.
4	#	So she works at the zoo?
4	#	Yeah, like Diane Fosse. You know she's the only person that's ever been accepted into gorilla society. And you know, once those gorillas accept you, you got it made in the shade.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Yeah, that's cool. Well, you gotta support your team.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Alright, that's enough out of you, there's still three more games left in this series, my friend, and it's far from being over. Very far from being over. (Notices a car coming right towards Puddy, who's crossing the street) Watch out!
4	#	Hey, Jerry? You're a smart guy, right?
4	#	Alright, you know I'm supposed to go on this special tour today with George's girlfriend.
4	#	Yeah, but before I met up with her, I stopped to look at the monkeys, when all of a sudden I am hit in the face with a banana peel. I turn and look and there is this monkey really laughing it up. Then someone tells me that he did it. Well, I pick up the banana peel and I wait for that monkey to turn around. And then I *whap* let him have it.
4	#	Well, he started it!
4	#	Well, he pushed my buttons, I couldn't help it, Jerry.
4	#	Alright, alright, fine. You take the monkey's side, alright, go ahead.
4	#	(walking out) Cause I know what happened, Jerry. (remembering something and walking back in) Did you call Alec Berg and thank him for the hockey tickets?
4	#	Oh, Jerry, what are you waiting for?
4	#	Oh, no no no, you gotta call him the next day, it's common courtesy.
4	#	Jerry, good manners are the glue of society.
4	#	Alright, you know what this is gonna do? He's gonna be upset because you didn't call him and we're not gonna get those tickets for Friday night.
4	#	Alright, where you going?
4	#	Who died?
4	#	So he actually had it?
4	#	Yes.
4	#	So, uh, what did you want to see me about?
4	#	Barry?
4	#	Oh. Well, uh, what's the problem?
4	#	So, so what do you want me to do?
4	#	Yeah, well he started it.
4	#	So am I. What about my feelings? Don't my feelings count for anything? Oh, only the poor monkey's important. Everything has to be done for the monkey! Look, I'm sorry. I--
4	#	(to Siena as she's walking out, but she appears to ignore) You know George really likes you.
4	#	Oh.
4	#	Hey. Well, I just spoke to your girlfriend.
4	#	Anyway, she asked me to apologize to Barry.
4	#	The monkey.
4	#	Nothing doing. Jerry, I didn't do anything. It's the monkey that should be apologizing to me.
4	#	Well, I'm sorry. Well, George, I tried to put the good word in for you with Siena, but I don't think she heard me. You know, left ear?
4	#	Yeah, her boss told me that she can't hear very well out of her left ear. What, you didn't know that?
4	#	What's going on?
4	#	Oh. Well listen, I almost forgot to ask you. What happened at the funeral? Now, did you talk to Alec berg?
4	#	Alright, so he's gonna give you the hockey tickets, huh?
4	#	He's mad, isn't he? See, I knew it.
4	#	Alright, so what happened when you saw him?
4	#	Uh huh.
4	#	See, I told you, Jerry, I told you!
4	#	I want you to get on this phone and give him his 'thank you'!
4	#	Jerry, this is the way society functions. Aren't you a part of society? Because if you don't want to be a part of society, Jerry, why don't you just get in your car and move to the East Side!
4	#	You stubborn, stupid, silly man!
4	#	Anyway, I um, I just want to say that I'm sorry. I lost my temper and I probably shouldn't have. I took it out on you and, look, if I've caused you any problems as a result of my behavior, well then, I'm sorry. I apologize. Even though, Barry, between me and you, we both know that you started it. I mean, who's kidding who? But they tell me that you're very upset, and god forbid I should disturb the very important monkey, I'm just hoping we can put this behind us, let's just move on with our lives, ok? So no hard feelings?
4	#	Well? Did he call?
4	#	Oh, come on, Jerry! Come on, this is stupid! It's six o'clock! It's all over, just pick up the phone and thank him!
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Where you going?
4	#	Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?
4	#	Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, don't tease me.
4	#	So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.
4	#	Who's Gennice?
4	#	Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?
4	#	Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers of the theater world.
4	#	You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!
4	#	So she's coming?
4	#	Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.
4	#	Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.
4	#	Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.
4	#	Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
4	#	Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry.
4	#	Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back.
4	#	Oh, uh, uh. (Leaves)
4	#	I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.
4	#	(holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time (sings) "You are the wind"
4	#	Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
4	#	SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.
4	#	So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)
4	#	(on phone) A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want whit e meat or dark?
4	#	Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. It's your ass buster.
4	#	yeah, all right, yeah. (hangs up) They don't have any. But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.
4	#	Now that's impossible.
4	#	Hi, here. I made this for your. (gives her a pasta statue)
4	#	It's macaroni Midler.
4	#	Yeah, see how you're singing?
4	#	oh, what's that from?
4	#	Oh You are so freaking talented.
4	#	Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.
4	#	No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.
4	#	Bette is recuperating right now and I'm not going to allow anything to disturb her.
4	#	I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!
4	#	AH! I don't want her disturbed.
4	#	What?
4	#	Really?
4	#	So, then you asked yourselves, "Isn't there something more to life?"
4	#	Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't.
4	#	Absolutely not. I mean, what are you thinking about, JERRY? Marriage? Family?
4	#	They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right if I use the bathroom now?
4	#	Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating.
4	#	Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know what you do at dinner?
4	#	You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, I don't know. How about you? How was your day?
4	#	It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs..
4	#	Oh, you have no idea.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	What dog?
4	#	Yeah. What dog?
4	#	Don't...
4	#	Well, there is something you can do.
4	#	Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?
4	#	No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes in exactely these kinds of sticky situations.
4	#	Look, just meet with him. ?????.
4	#	NEWMAN ! Stop it!!
4	#	I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt.
4	#	Huh?
4	#	Hey!
4	#	Nothing.
4	#	Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go.
4	#	Out.
4	#	Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing this dog a huge favor.
4	#	Oh, no. I don't wear a watch.
4	#	Well, I tell time by the sun.
4	#	Well, I can guess within an hour.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours.
4	#	You got it?
4	#	Well, get him to bark.
4	#	Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
4	#	Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's.
4	#	Hi.
4	#	Uh, yes. Yeah.
4	#	Oh, yeah, that's...
4	#	What?
4	#	Arrest?
4	#	Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?
4	#	Oh, hey!
4	#	Elaine, listen, I was talking to a friend about this dog business. Do you realize this is gonna be on our permanent records? Are you aware of this?
4	#	It can never be erased. It'll follow us wherever we go for the rest of our lives. I'll never be able to get a job. I mean, doesn't that concern you? Everything I've worked for...down the drain because of one stupid mistake. I mean, aren't we entitled to make one mistake in our lives, Jerry?
4	#	Yes!
4	#	Hey, hey.
4	#	Definitely.
4	#	No, no, I would turn you in.
4	#	Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.
4	#	What kind of person are you going around killing people?
4	#	Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be next?
4	#	I thought I DID!
4	#	Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
4	#	You better believe it.
4	#	Since when are you so trendy?
4	#	I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't looked back.
4	#	I've always wanted to see this.
4	#	Well, yeah, lets do it uh?
4	#	Maybe I will.
4	#	Why not?
4	#	Well that's stupid
4	#	Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.
4	#	Oh, yow, oow Ah!
4	#	Nothing Nothing.
4	#	I don't have anything. Ask him.
4	#	What?!
4	#	Ow
4	#	Sorry? Are you kidding? You did me the biggest favor of my life. I spoke to a lawyer, we're suing for millions.
4	#	The coffee was too hot.
4	#	Not THAT hot.
4	#	So ya know, my friend and I we were going to the movies and we stopped off and bought this cafe latte.
4	#	Yeah that's right.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Yes I did.
4	#	No I wasn't able to sip it in my normal fashion.
4	#	Well I think I take a normal sip.
4	#	Well you know ahh, they don't allow outside drinks in the movie theater. So I had to put it in my shirt and sneak it in.
4	#	Yeah, now is that going to be a problem?
4	#	It's definitely preposterous.
4	#	Well ahh. I was trying to get to my seat and I had to step over someone and I kind of got pushed and it spilled on me.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	No. They put the top on.
4	#	Ah No no, I haven't.
4	#	So ah, what do you think Mr. Chiles.
4	#	Jackie. I mean, we have a chance?
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Oh I ah just came from a meeting with my lawyer.
4	#	Oh I'll tell you how it's looking. My lawyer Jackie says if there is one coffee drinker on that jury, (in a very high voice) I'm gonna be a rich man.
4	#	Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.
4	#	Oh I can be quite litigious.
4	#	Yeah but Jackie says the top was faulty.
4	#	Hey Maestro!
4	#	I'm in here. How's it going.
4	#	Well, this is a surprise ha?
4	#	Oh Maestro, you, what are you doing? You don't have to do this. Do you believe this Maestro?
4	#	Yeah, ya know you haven't been around for a while.
4	#	Oh Tuscany huh? Hear that Jerry? That's in Italy.
4	#	Maestro.
4	#	Yeah, yeah oh hey and a thanks for the balm. Yeah.
4	#	You know you hurt the Maestro's feelings.
4	#	That's right.
4	#	Why?
4	#	Jerry he's a conductor.
4	#	Well, he's still a conductor.
4	#	Oh, you should see him do 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'.
4	#	Hey, hey, hey, listen to this. Jackie just called.
4	#	Yeah, Java World wants to settle.
4	#	Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.
4	#	Cause their afraid of bad publicity.
4	#	Yeah that's right.
4	#	Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry my burn is gone look.(shows Jerry the burn area).
4	#	Well I put that Chinese balm on that the Maestro gave me. And look, it healed it.
4	#	So? My lawsuit. I'm finished.
4	#	Well what happens if they want to see it?
4	#	Yeah!!
4	#	I guess I screwed up huh Jackie?
4	#	The Maestro.
4	#	My friend he's a conductor.
4	#	Well my stomach was burning.
4	#	Well I didn't know the balm was gonna work.
4	#	Well I ...
4	#	I'm sorry Jackie.
4	#	(Motions with his head) Yeah, get over.
4	#	(Interrupting) I'LL TAKE IT!!
4	#	No.
4	#	Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Well I didn't hear any Plus.
4	#	Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get out here. I'm gonna get myself a free cafe latte.
4	#	(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.
4	#	Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.
4	#	That's it. What you want one George? I can get one for you. No problem. Jerry, you want one? They're delicious. My pleasure.
4	#	Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to tell.
4	#	Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.
4	#	Common Jerry, this guy is crazy. Get out.
4	#	I didn't push you. How much did you pay that guy?
4	#	75,000 lira? Are you out of your mind?
4	#	Oh, conversion rate, oh.
4	#	Nobody put a gun to your head.
4	#	Yeah!
4	#	Hi guys.
4	#	Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's signature?
4	#	And Buck Showalter's?
4	#	Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.
4	#	No, of course not. (winks back)
4	#	You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.
4	#	Why?
4	#	Ah, Mr. Weatherbee.
4	#	Sure do.
4	#	Here you go.
4	#	You'll be pleased to see what's inside.
4	#	You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed birthday card that was inside.
4	#	You did.
4	#	No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. (winks)
4	#	Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the hospital .
4	#	Look, do you want me to get it back or not?
4	#	That you Bobby?
4	#	Well, I heard that you have a very uh, special birthday card .with all the Yankee autographs on it.
4	#	Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person at the New York Yankees needed this card back.
4	#	Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.
4	#	All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, just for you.
4	#	For you he would.
4	#	Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something for me.
4	#	Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.
4	#	Mr. O'Neill?
4	#	Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me.
4	#	No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.
4	#	Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.
4	#	You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers.
4	#	Yeah, well, no good?
4	#	Two is better than one.
4	#	Well, Babe Ruth did it.
4	#	Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?
4	#	Well, maybe I did overextend myself.
4	#	It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!
4	#	You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one game. Even for Paul O'Neill.
4	#	He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.
4	#	Come on Come on!
4	#	GO! GO!!
4	#	An In The Park Home Run!
4	#	All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed card)
4	#	Huh?
4	#	Yeah, maybe not technically, but
4	#	Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!
4	#	Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that
4	#	Hi,
4	#	Oh, it's a birthday card.
4	#	(to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has to catch a fly ball in his hat.
4	#	And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
4	#	Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
4	#	I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter to seven and... (makes sound with the lips - "pop!") ...I get up!
4	#	It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, your body has an internal mechanism. It knows what time it is.
4	#	Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.
4	#	Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. (points to bucket)
4	#	Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage jets oscillating and pulsating, soothing your every aching muscle. The water's gonna get over 120 degrees! (happy)
4	#	Oh...it's tolerable...! (happy)
4	#	Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and leaves)
4	#	(smelling) What's burning?
4	#	This was set for 2 minutes. See?
4	#	Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak.
4	#	Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the windows... the air is cold, the tub is boiling hot... It's like Sweden, man. Sweeeeden!
4	#	(relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really enjoying this)
4	#	Heeeeey...
4	#	Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? Boiling hot.
4	#	I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water went down to 58 degrees. I can't get my core temperature back up!
4	#	(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.
4	#	Yeah, I turned up the heat.
4	#	I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.
4	#	Uh? Oh that must be it.
4	#	Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial strength. 16000 BTU's.
4	#	(shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! We're almost up to 80 degrees!
4	#	Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the "pop!" sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)
4	#	Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses!
4	#	I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer falls down)
4	#	(to Elaine) You want some hot tea?
4	#	Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!
4	#	Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling)
4	#	Hey.
4	#	[taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah.
4	#	Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on.
4	#	Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!
4	#	Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.
4	#	Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.
4	#	Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era.
4	#	He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are.
4	#	Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
4	#	No. No, Elaine!
4	#	Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
4	#	You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
4	#	Huh?
4	#	What is this, huh?
4	#	Well, b -- it was stolen.
4	#	These street toughs, they robbed me.
4	#	Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me.
4	#	Well, where's the soup?
4	#	Oh...yeah!
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.
4	#	No.
4	#	Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.
4	#	And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that.
4	#	Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional.
4	#	How can I possibly thank you?
4	#	You suffer for your soup.
4	#	You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.
4	#	Git.
4	#	And..voila!
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?
4	#	Yeah!
4	#	How 'bout zero?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the Soup Nazi.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man.
4	#	Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....
4	#	Yeah. Well, he's a dear.
4	#	Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Yeah. That's them.
4	#	No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.
4	#	No!
4	#	Excuse me.
4	#	Uh, well, uh, we --
4	#	Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we?
4	#	Leapin' Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.
4	#	Well, it's an emergency band scanner, it picks up everything Fires, harbor patrol, even the police. I'm watching the watchers, Jerry. Uh oh, we got a big fire on 115th. I tell ya if could do it over again, I'd give it all up to be a fireman.
4	#	When I was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that big hook and ladder.
4	#	No no no, they're talking the West Side Highway, at this time of day that's insane. They're heading straight into gridlock. Oh, those fools.
4	#	I just came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is that what you've sunk to?
4	#	Oh, oh your foot fell asleep.
4	#	Well, you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you, munjamba?
4	#	Boy, look at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday.
4	#	They just don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got us to Yankee Stadium in rush hour in fifteen minutes?
4	#	It's all up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate.
4	#	I'll bet I can guess it.
4	#	Oh, alright. Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out birthdays immediately. That's too obvious. And no numbers for you, you're a word man. Alright, let's go deeper. Uh, what kind of man are you? Well, you're weak, spineless, a man of temptations, but what tempts you?
4	#	You're a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your pleasure? Is it the salty snacks you crave? No no no no no, yours is a sweet tooth.
4	#	Oh you may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the cocoa bean.
4	#	(building up steam as George bolts for the door) No, and only the purest syrup nectar can satisfy you!
4	#	If you could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!
4	#	Nestl's Quik!
4	#	Hey, you wanna come down the fire station with me?
4	#	Yeah, I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world!
4	#	Oh, so he took you back.
4	#	Well, you know the important thing is that you learned something.
4	#	Yeah, and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the Village, then you're gonna see a magic show.
4	#	Leapin' Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.
4	#	Are you ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?
4	#	Well, you'd better take it easy.
4	#	It's Kramer!
4	#	DeSoto's down, but Cosmo's got the caboose.
4	#	Don't worry, Cap, I can handle it!
4	#	Oh, no, of course you don't. You're a Man's Woman. You hate other women, and they hate you.
4	#	So Jerry, (smacks hands and rubs palms together) What time we going to the movies?
4	#	Saddle up and ride. (opens the fridge and pulls out some food -- takes a big bite)
4	#	(mumbling with full mouth) No, Im good.
4	#	There's nothing more pathetic, than a grown man, whos afraid of a woman . (voice get high-pitched for the last line)
4	#	That's gunna be trouble.
4	#	Jerry, don't you see? This world here, this is George's sanctuary. If Susan comes into contact with this world, his world's collide. You know what happens then?
4	#	Ka shha shha shha Pkooo (exploding sound)
4	#	Did I tell you Im getting a new telephone number?
4	#	Whew, chicks man. Too many chicks know my number.
4	#	Oh, yeah.
4	#	What's in the deep end?
4	#	You want to sit here?
4	#	Why?
4	#	(Quietly) Buffer zone (Kramer moves to the other seat)
4	#	No. You got a point.
4	#	I can't ...
4	#	Well these seats have no lumbar.
4	#	We are talking.
4	#	So, ah then, I ah had to kill him and ah, well the police are still looking for me.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	What is it blowing up?
4	#	Cosmo, go. No, no, na, na. (he pushes the end button and pushes the antenna down) Boy this new telephone number's driving me crazy -- wrong numbers, every five minutes.
4	#	Well it's 555-3455.

4	#	Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with myself.
4	#	I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the walk, baby. (gets up) I'll be right back.
4	#	Are you still on the pill?
4	#	I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an open forum.
4	#	But wasn't that taken off the market?
4	#	I read it in Wall Street Week ...Louis, uh, Rukeyser.
4	#	Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!
4	#	Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?

4	#	Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.
4	#	Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just don't wear the ribbon.
4	#	This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to wear!
4	#	(handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.
4	#	(removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from the Alex Theatre.
4	#	(sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up the place.
4	#	(lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps as his burns his fingers) Twelve extra minutes, full wide-screen CinemaScope, and if you come to the one o'clock show, you can hear Geoffrey Har-harwood.
4	#	Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus. Some fascinating insights into the production.
4	#	Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something in the microwave? Why go to the park and fly a kite, when you can just pop a pill? (looks around Monk's) Listen, you guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun, have you? I'm supposed to meet him here.
4	#	Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh, get the theatre landmark status.
4	#	Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown? Had to spend a few months in an institution.
4	#	Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my wing.
4	#	But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here treat him like he's one of the gang, huh.
4	#	Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)
4	#	(slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)
4	#	Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.
4	#	Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious it is. (he takes pieces for himself and Jerry)
4	#	Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating the gum.
4	#	Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.
4	#	The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden era of movie palaces. Minor restorations in nineteen forty-one, forty-seven, fifty-two, fifty-eight, sixty-three, and currently to our present period of time.
4	#	Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark status from the City. We're hoping Lloyd Braun can pull a few strings.
4	#	Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry. (to Elaine) And you should say hello to him, Elaine.
4	#	(emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just forgot 'em, that's all. (puts an arm round Lloyd's shoulder) Not crazy.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	(slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.
4	#	Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.
4	#	Yeah, put these glasses on.
4	#	Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.
4	#	Well, he thinks you wear those.
4	#	They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
4	#	Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit with him on purpose. Ooh yeah, that's very nice. Very nice.
4	#	Hey, Jerry, look who's here.
4	#	Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?
4	#	Oh, boy.
4	#	Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, sitting around, chewing gum, huh? Mmm, mmm, yeah. So uh, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this.
4	#	Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.
4	#	No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it. Don't you, Jerry?
4	#	Yeah?
4	#	Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?
4	#	Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom, ba-boom-ba-ba-ba-boom-ba.
4	#	Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you back at the Alex Theatre.
4	#	Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?
4	#	Brown?
4	#	Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon. Listen, could you keep an eye on the place? I wanna go out and get some paraffin wax, and bring out the lustre of this vintage countertop.
4	#	Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?
4	#	Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you want to.
4	#	No kidding.
4	#	Yeah, merry Christmas.
4	#	What, he's not here yet?
4	#	Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.
4	#	They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.
4	#	(proffering) Here, try this pair.
4	#	(clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.
4	#	Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check out lost and found.
4	#	Uh, yeah.
4	#	Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?
4	#	No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing wrong with it or you.
4	#	No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter) One hotdog please.
4	#	Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?
4	#	Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's delicious. Mmm. It's a perfectly sane food to eat. (he takes another bite)
4	#	Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches) I gotta get, some air.
4	#	Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you, but this is too much. Parading around in a wet T-shirt.
4	#	Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not one of your swing joints.
4	#	Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.
4	#	Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W.
4	#	Is that from Henry the Eighth?
4	#	Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do you think that I could wear that to promote the theatre?
4	#	(an idea occurs) You don't say.
4	#	You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
4	#	Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.
4	#	Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a premiere.
4	#	Oh, he ran away.
4	#	I need to talk to you.
4	#	Oh, tell me about it.
4	#	Hey, Jerry! Listen, I need you to come downstairs, help me get my stuff outta the car.
4	#	I just came from the price club. I'm loaded up, baby.
4	#	Course I will. These are staples.
4	#	Lindsay olives, Jerry.
4	#	$17.50. You can't beat that.
4	#	Yeah. Star Kist, Jerry. Most tuna don't make their cut.
4	#	Hey, Clyde!
4	#	Yeah. Ahh. Hey, this is Jerry here.
4	#	You know, Clyde, he plays backup with John Germaine.
4	#	Hey, how 'bout giving me a hand? You know, bring some of this stuff upstairs.
4	#	Uh-huh.
4	#	Yeah. Sure. Sure.
4	#	Drive the horse?
4	#	Oh, giddyup. Yeah.
4	#	Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed in 1850 by Joe Peppitone. Um, built during the Civil War so the northern armies could practice fighting on...on grass. Oh, yeah. Giddyup. On Rusty!
4	#	Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta do is be there at seven?
4	#	Hey.
4	#	It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
4	#	Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I don't have any room for it all.
4	#	Yeah. That's Rusty.
4	#	Uh-huh.
4	#	You wanna go see him?
4	#	I'll show ya Rusty.
4	#	Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. (singing) I'm so keen-o On Beef-A-Reeno What a delicious cuisine-o Fit for a king and queen-o! Yeah. Eat up. I got thirty four more cans.
4	#	Ah ha!
4	#	Ahh! Mr. Ross. Mrs. Ross. My name is Cosmo and I'll be your driver for this evening. We have blankets for your comfort. I also have hot chocolate if the mood should strike you.
4	#	Well, if we're all set to go, why don't you two hop aboard and let me show you a little taste of old New York...the way it once was. Oh, happy anniversary. On, Rusty!
4	#	Y'aah!
4	#	Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything?
4	#	Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff.
4	#	Rusty! Rusty!
4	#	Whoa!
4	#	I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the gastrointestinal workings of the equine are going to function.
4	#	The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
4	#	Well, I overbought!
4	#	Just a can. But he really liked it, though.
4	#	I don't wanna go back on there!
4	#	Hello boys.
4	#	Yes, indeed. The calendar says winter, but he gods of spring are out.
4	#	No, no........I'm sneaking in with Stan the Caddy, we've been going through the caddies entrance.
4	#	Yeah, and I'll tell ya something else. Stan's advice has transformed my game. He's never wrong. Oh, he thinks eventually I'll have a shot at making it big on the senior tour. (sucks in air through tight lips) Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.
4	#	Oh, I'm the real deal.
4	#	Yeah, here, Stan, in here!
4	#	There he is, yeah - Jerry, George, *this* is Stan the Caddy.

4	#	Ah, that makes sense, that's a good call, Stan. Alright, we'll see you guys later, huh?

4	#	Wait a second....
4	#	I'll just snag the lock with this. auhh Here we go...
4	#	Well, George has gotta be happy about this.
4	#	Oh, mama.
4	#	Well I got a cut on my head and I banged my shoulder. (He has a large Band-aid on his forehead)
4	#	Well I couldn't help it, you saw what she was wearing.
4	#	Hey you know, my arm really hurts. I wonder if its gonna affect my golf swing.
4	#	Oohh.
4	#	Yeah, it's my left arm, I can't swing it!
4	#	Well what happens if I can't play like I was? What about the tour, and all my dreams?
4	#	Sue her?
4	#	Ah, No, no, no, I can't. I learned my lesson from that coffee company.
4	#	What do you think, Stan?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Well then we saw this woman, and she was wearing a bra with no top.
4	#	Yeah.So I got distracted and I crashed the car.
4	#	Oh, yeah.
4	#	She was flouting.
4	#	It was outrageous. And she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
4	#	I said she's the heir to the O'Henry candy bar fortune.
4	#	No.
4	#	So whadda ya think, Jackie? I mean we got a case?
4	#	Well, buddy, (claps) he's taking the case! Jackie Chiles is right on it! Right on it, he's all over it!
4	#	Why, wh-wh-what's wrong, come on?
4	#	uuh-
4	#	Yeah-
4	#	Well, your attitude has certainly changed.
4	#	Now listen, Jerry, I'm gonna need you to testify.
4	#	Jerry, Jerry, you gotta testify!
4	#	Listen, this is a million dollars we're talkin' about, Jerry, now this is the big league, the big time, now I need you on my team, Jerry!
4	#	Alright what's gotten into you, what's happened?!?
4	#	Oh I see....Yessss. Little Miss Candy Bar paid a visit, didn't she?
4	#	Ah, Ah, Ahhhhh! I know what I think. I think you're gaga over this dame. She's twisted you around her little finger, and now, you're willing to sell me, and Elaine, and whoever else you have to, right down the river.
4	#	You're just out for sex!!
4	#	Three under par.
4	#	Well if they're lucky.
4	#	Yeah, yeah...What's your read, Stan?
4	#	What do you mean?
4	#	Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.
4	#	He's my caddy.
4	#	Gu-gu- cada-
4	#	OK, OK-
4	#	(sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good.
4	#	Oh yeah, I got a big appetite.
4	#	Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh.
4	#	(examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? No, I said mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
4	#	Ah, 's no good.
4	#	No. That's bush league.
4	#	No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without Dijon.
4	#	Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy with our arrangement?
4	#	Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I wanted from your fridge, and you could take whatever you want from mine.
4	#	Oh, hey.
4	#	Aw, you really hurting, huh?
4	#	Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted.
4	#	Alright, lean forward, relax.
4	#	Encounter shiatsu.
4	#	(continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the Healing power of the body's natural pressure points.
4	#	(to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
4	#	He's a genius. Here we go...
4	#	From pain, will come pleasure.
4	#	Uh? Voila.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Awright, my work is done here.
4	#	(closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time.
4	#	Ah, I got it.
4	#	(putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. Refrigerator problem, is solved.
4	#	Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I want.
4	#	Here. I write it down. (he writes) "One cupcake." And then I put it in the bowl. (he tears off the sheet, crumples it and drops it into the bowl) There. Very simple.
4	#	No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em all up, and you give me the bill.
4	#	Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When Elaine comes by with that bike, you hang onto it for me, alright?
4	#	Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other at our word, all is lost.
4	#	(waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab.
4	#	Hey buddy.
4	#	No, that's yours. My half is gone.
4	#	Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your beef?
4	#	Well, why not.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Alright.
4	#	Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?
4	#	(deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
4	#	Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. He gets it from his butcher.
4	#	Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are the last person I figured would do something like this. I mean, George, yeah, I can see that. Even Jerry. But not you, Elaine...
4	#	I always put you up here...
4	#	...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
4	#	(points) Digidi.
4	#	You got that right!
4	#	Oh, great ride.
4	#	What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
4	#	Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a week.
4	#	Well, it's common sense.
4	#	Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should settle this.
4	#	Alright, I'm down.
4	#	Newman!
4	#	Uh, yeah.
4	#	No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another than see it destroyed. Newman, give it to her, I beg you.
4	#	Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise.
4	#	Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride.
4	#	(indicating the cereal) Hey, Jerry, if you're gonna be snacking on these, you can't expect me to pay for the whole box.
4	#	(does a double take) Yikes.
4	#	Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
4	#	I'm good for it.
4	#	(opening the door) Alright. I'll get that money for you in five minutes. And, don't eat any more.
4	#	Hey! You're back!
4	#	Yeah, how was it?
4	#	Good for you.
4	#	You killed.
4	#	Unbelievable.
4	#	How much?
4	#	Aw, c'mon.
4	#	I tell you how much I make.
4	#	Just show me the cheque, c'mon.
4	#	I wanna see it.
4	#	(stunned) Whuf! This is unbelievable.
4	#	My god, you're rich.
4	#	I didn't know you made that kinda money. (subdued) Jeez.
4	#	I don't think I can talk to you any more. I feel inferior.
4	#	You know, Jerry, I think this changes the relationship. I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?
4	#	Well, what're you gonna do with all that money?
4	#	(pleased) Really?
4	#	Well, you should, Jerry.
4	#	Now, you see, that's nice.
4	#	(smiles) Cadillac. Ooh-la-la.
4	#	You're gonna score some big points with the man upstairs on this one.
4	#	Oh, yeah?
4	#	Oh. Yeah, I been getting HBO and Showtime for free. See, they just found out about it, so now they wanna come and take it out.
4	#	Oh, was he? Was he? I guess the cable man doesn't like to be kept waiting.
4	#	You remember what they did to me ten years ago? "Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one", or "We'll be there between two and six"! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors. (malice) Now, they want me to accommodate them. Well, looks like the shoe's on the other foot, doesn't it?
4	#	Oh, you don't wanna get on my bad side.
4	#	Quiet, quiet.
4	#	I'm loving this.
4	#	Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.
4	#	Y'hello.
4	#	Hmm. Well, I haven't had any trouble.
4	#	(playing along) Ohh, is that right? Well, I have been having a little trouble with my call-waiting.
4	#	(sitting back on the couch) Oh, can you? That's funny, because, as it happens, I don't have call-waiting. Seems to me that the phone company would know that.
4	#	Yeah. Could you hold on for a second? I've got something on the stove.
4	#	Hey, McNab!
4	#	Chunnel's on HBO tonight. Why don't you stop by?
4	#	Hello.
4	#	Ohh, it's Hanaran now, is it?
4	#	Oh, you don't say.
4	#	(impressed) Ohh, you're good. You are really good.
4	#	Hey. Super's in my bathroom changing my shower head. Have they changed your shower head?
4	#	Low flow? Well I don't like the sound of that.
4	#	Jerry? Jerry!
4	#	Wha, you too?
4	#	These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't get the shampoo out of my hair.
4	#	If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak and ineffectual. I'm not Kramer.
4	#	(leaving) Aw.
4	#	I gotta find another shower.
4	#	They got you too?
4	#	Oh, Elaine. Yeah.
4	#	Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a shower.
4	#	There's no water pressure.
4	#	Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only one I know who's got the good stuff, and I need it bad, baby, cause I feel like I got bugs crawling up my skin. Now you gotta help me out.
4	#	(halfheartedly) Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya.
4	#	I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?
4	#	It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my own filth. All kinds of microscopic parasites and organisms having sex all around me.
4	#	Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in that.
4	#	Oh, yeah.
4	#	Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some chicken?
4	#	I'm down.
4	#	Power, man. Power.
4	#	That's for radiation.
4	#	(pointing to the largest one) Now, what is this?
4	#	Well that's what we want, the Commando 450.
4	#	He couldn't handle that, he's delicate.
4	#	What?
4	#	Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still salvage some sauce..
4	#	(Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
4	#	Well, why don't you do your material?
4	#	(Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.
4	#	(Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? (Eats the bread)
4	#	(Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit on Styrofoam?
4	#	Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"
4	#	It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
4	#	Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"
4	#	Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.
4	#	(Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..
4	#	So, what's your game? What do you like to play?
4	#	No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight pool.. hmm?
4	#	Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..
4	#	I'll break.
4	#	(Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh, learning the subtleties of the table.
4	#	(Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..
4	#	Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally crashing it into the window)
4	#	Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.
4	#	A billiard room.
4	#	(Confused) What?
4	#	(Snaps) The Place To Be!
4	#	Oh, yeah?
4	#	Really?
4	#	That's good thinking.
4	#	Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain perfectly creased.
4	#	Come on. Are you sure?
4	#	Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.
4	#	(Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how to follow through correctly.
4	#	Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back slowly..
4	#	Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) You know where it's going..
4	#	(Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!
4	#	Hey everybody. (to Jerry) Listen, uh, do me a favour, will you? I got a hot date tonight with Connie. Knock on my door, wake me up in twenty minutes, alright?
4	#	No, no, no, no. (comes in) This is evolutionary. I been reading this book, on Leonardo de Vinci. See, that means 'from Vinci', d'you know that?
4	#	Yeah, well, turns out that the master slept only twenty minutes every three hours. Now, that works out to two and a half extra days, that I'm awake per week, every week. Which means, if I live to be eighty, I will have lived the equivalent of a hundred and five years.
4	#	Oh, I got a lot of things in the hopper, buddy.
4	#	(smiling) Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.
4	#	Yeah, morning.
4	#	Yeah, what time is it?
4	#	(pleased) Ah, see. (rubs his hands together) I got the whole night ahead of me. (looks at Jerry) Boy, that's a nice jacket, huh?
4	#	Yeah, I like that crest. (he shakes cereal into the bowl) Alright, here we go.
4	#	(pouring cereal) Oh yeah. Most important meal of the day.
4	#	(enthusiastic) Oh, I'm percolating, Jerry. I'm telling you, I have never felt so fertile. I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy. Listen to this idea. (fetches a spoon from the drawer) A restaurant that serves only peanut butter and jelly. (clicks tongue)
4	#	P B and J's. What d'you think?
4	#	(dismissive) Ahh.
4	#	I am telling you, this woman is strange. She never wants to leave the apartment. It's almost like she doesn't wanna be seen with me.
4	#	(laughing) He he, yeah.
4	#	Oh, I'll be back.
4	#	(quietly) Jerry.
4	#	(quietly) Hey Jerry.
4	#	(prodding Jerry) C'mon buddy.
4	#	You awake?
4	#	W...It's four.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	I'm bored. I got all this free time on my hands, I dunno what to do. You wanna do something?
4	#	You wanna rent a movie?
4	#	Well, what am I gonna do?
4	#	Oh, boy.
4	#	Oh, the one with the crest.
4	#	Well, I, uh, I borrowed it last night and it got a little dirty.
4	#	(laughing to himself) Somehow I dozed off and woke up in a pile of garbage.
4	#	Well, so, look, the cleaner said you could pick it up tonight at six.
4	#	Watch out, boy.
4	#	So, uhm, are you sure you don't wanna go to the movies?
4	#	Oh, it's uh, it's a bold adventure.
4	#	Ooh. Well, this is uh, risky business, huh? I'm all a-twitter.
4	#	HEY!! Sh..! Shii! MAMA!!
4	#	AAH! AAGH!
4	#	God.
4	#	(animated) She tried to kill me Jerry!
4	#	(shouts) Connie!
4	#	I don't know! (building to a shout) But I woke up in the Hudson river in a SACK!! I think she drugged me, but she's a murderer and I'm calling the cops.
4	#	(animated) Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't want anybody else to have me!
4	#	(to door) Gah!
4	#	(pointing) That's her, officer.
4	#	(animated) What? Sleeping with the fishes? I guess I woke up!
4	#	(sarcastic) Oh, yeah! Yeah!
4	#	Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year and a half.
4	#	About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for a peek..
4	#	Euh what...What lot is that?
4	#	Seventy -five bucks a month!
4	#	Oh I'm down.
4	#	(frantically pulling at his doorknob) Thank god you're home. I'm wiped out. I drop my car at Jiffy Park and I forgot to take my apartment keys off the ring. So you got my spare?
4	#	y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take me over there?
4	#	Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth avenue..
4	#	I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a car!
4	#	Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up.
4	#	Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?
4	#	I like 'em all(still fiddles with the radio)
4	#	(seems to pickup something on the floor) ....'s'this?
4	#	Gawd!!!
4	#	That's a....ca.....ca..........Condom!!
4	#	Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to get into my apartment.
4	#	...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What you got on your mind?
4	#	Mary Kay uh?
4	#	(to George) Well listen See you later ..thanks for driving me by..
4	#	Oh yeah!!
4	#	Oooooh ...Pops .... Wow!! Spectacular.
4	#	Heeeeeummmrph.... I'm gonna turn in
4	#	Yeah,I had a tough day
4	#	Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an argument you can't win.
4	#	Well you can go to your room and read.
4	#	But I'm tired..
4	#	Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too thin...I know I'm gonna get cold. I don't even fit on this couch. Don't even know if I'm gonna sleep....
4	#	Can I sleep with you?
4	#	Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice warm quilt.
4	#	Why?
4	#	Yeah!
4	#	Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)
4	#	Hi...........What's that?
4	#	Wow.
4	#	Yeaaahmm....
4	#	Ooh Mama...( walks away)
4	#	How do you know he's not wondering the same thing about you?
4	#	What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're working him for the discount. Shaking that little butt of yours into big, big savings.... And then when you get it,you know, you drop him like a hot potato.
4	#	Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and then and only then will there be a free exchange of sex and discounts.. Cornerstones of a healthy relationship....and now if you would (taps twice on the door) excuse us. We need to get to bed.
4	#	(softly)hmmm....patio furniture's on sale.
4	#	It's Halloween (not sure)
4	#	Hey! Elaine..
4	#	These are my friends Jerry and Elaine.
4	#	Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig master for the show.
4	#	Well what are we ...dog meat.
4	#	Yeah. See ou later..
4	#	Hey! You gonna let me try the other one right?'
4	#	Hey! Who do you think you're talking to.
4	#	Bye!!
4	#	(looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey! lets go.
4	#	Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where you going.
4	#	Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)
4	#	(cries) I'M NOT A PIMP.!!!.
4	#	Feel this.
4	#	Yeah. It's piquing hot. It's fresh out of the dryer. Hey Elaine you have to feel my pants.
4	#	Oh. All right. You don't know what your missing. I'm loving this Jerry. I am never putting on another piece of clothing unless it's straight out of the dryer.
4	#	Oh yeah. It's a warm and wonderful feeling, Jerry. So what are you doing later?
4	#	Oh yeah she's a beauty.
4	#	Oh bold and beautiful.
4	#	Hey buddy.
4	#	I am looking for quarters for the dryer.
4	#	Because I don't have a table.
4	#	Ah!! I found a quarter. Anybody want there clothes heated up?
4	#	Hey buddy. I am waiting for my shirt.
4	#	I didn't have any quarters for the dryer. Anyway this is better. And it's more convenient.
4	#	And I have a lot more control. I have one shirt going for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.
4	#	I am baking a pie!
4	#	You got cigars, huh.
4	#	Oh yeah baby. spit, spit. What are these?"Perducto de Peru"Jerry, if you think these are Cubans you have another thing coming.
4	#	You got ripped buddy.
4	#	That's a nice name. Todd Gack. Is that Dutch? (Dingggggg) Oh baby. Here we go. Uh momma.(putting his fresh out of the oven shirt on) Hey George hey.
4	#	I decided to go with the brown one 's. (pants)
4	#	Pisano's. That's the place by the stadium right?
4	#	Yeah. Newman raves about it. It's on his mail route. He goes by there everyday.
4	#	Huckleberry.
4	#	Hey you!
4	#	What happened to Newman?
4	#	Oh yeah right it's raining.
4	#	What time do you need it at?
4	#	No. I got eight tons of change. I'm loaded.
4	#	Hey hold that bus!
4	#	Hey. It's really wet out there.
4	#	I here you make a pretty mean calzone.
4	#	Yeah calzone.
4	#	All right. Lay them on me. I'll take three.
4	#	Hey. That's a big oven. Huh. Listen. I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
4	#	Oh. This is all burned up. Look at this.
4	#	That's all I got.
4	#	I told you this is all I got.
4	#	The guy wouldn't give them to me because I wanted to pay in change.
4	#	He overcooked it. It's ruined.
4	#	You Gack?
4	#	Here's your money.
4	#	Hey buddy.
4	#	(tossing car keys to Jerry) Yeah.
4	#	You shoulda come, Jerry.
4	#	Price club.
4	#	Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.
4	#	What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't throw that away.
4	#	You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read the label here. (reads from bottle) Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York. Refund, (brings bottle up close to Newman's eyes) vrrup, five cents.
4	#	Yes.
4	#	That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	No, it doesn't work.
4	#	Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on gasoline. Trust me, it doesn't work.
4	#	No, no, I'm off that.
4	#	Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove me crazy.
4	#	No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got permits, weigh-stations, tolls... Look, you're way outta your league.
4	#	Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he is.
4	#	(to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.
4	#	We ran outta space.
4	#	Ah, Tony, he's good.
4	#	(offering the artichoke can) 'Choke?'
4	#	Wha...?
4	#	Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.
4	#	(interested) Uh-huh.
4	#	(realisation) Mother's Day.
4	#	A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost structure. Our G and A goes down fifty percent.
4	#	Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!
4	#	Three quarters of a tank.
4	#	That's better than we estimated.
4	#	Ah, no, that's not in the budget.
4	#	That's not a good investment, that's a loss.
4	#	Hey, d'you see that car? Looks like Jerry's. I'm gonna check out that license plate.
4	#	Yeah, those are New York plates.
4	#	I don't know, but that's New York and we're in Ohio. Those are pretty good odds.
4	#	I'm calling Jerry.
4	#	Brought my phone.
4	#	Yeah, hey Jerry, what's your licence plate number?
4	#	Yeah, well I think I spotted your car.
4	#	(checks the car ahead of him) Hey, that's it! That's it. Hey, uh look, we got him. We're driving right behind him in a truck.
4	#	Well we're in the country and we're right on his tail.
4	#	Yeah, don't worry Jerry. We're right on this guy like stink on a monkey! I'll check back with you.
4	#	Yeah, nothing. We're still following him.
4	#	Wait a second, he's getting off. Yeah, he's gonna be going south on the one-thirty-five.
4	#	Alright, alright, I'll follow him.
4	#	Yeah, hey listen, I can't. It's gonna be taking us out of our way.
4	#	Well, I don't know what to do.
4	#	Well, I don't know what to do man!
4	#	Alright! Alright. I'm getting off! I'm gonna go on the ramp.
4	#	This ramp is steep.
4	#	Alright, look, we're pulling too much weight. He's getting away from us here. (indicating) Take the wheel.
4	#	(climbing though into the back of the truck) I'm gonna get something.
4	#	Keep your foot on the gas.
4	#	Look out below!!
4	#	(frustrated) Damn. I don't understand this. I've ditched every bottle and can, and we still can't gain. It's like we're...
4	#	...sluggish.
4	#	Heyy, wasn't that a pie stand back there?
4	#	Oh yeah. Home-made pies, two hundred yards back.
4	#	Well open the door, you get a better look.
4	#	I'm sorry Newman, you were holding us back.
4	#	(shouting) Jerry! We've lost the fat man, and we're running lean. We're back on track, buddy!
4	#	Jerry, we got 'im. I'm riding his tail. There's no escape. He's running scared, buddy.
4	#	(checks dial) I got enough to get to Memphis.
4	#	He's reaching in back. He's grabbing at something.
4	#	He's pulling out a gun! He's got a gun, Jerry!!
4	#	It's a golf club! It's no gun. He threw a golf club at me!
4	#	Hey, I'm under fire here. (another club hits) I'm under heavy fire here, boy. (another hit) Jeez! That was a five-iron!
4	#	Wait a minute, I think he's done. (peers at the Saab) Oh no, he's taking out the woods!
4	#	(noise)
4	#	(yelling at Tony) You'll have to do a lot better than that!
4	#	This truck is dying. We're losing him.
4	#	I think we lost him.
4	#	(subdued) Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em.
4	#	What you doing?!
4	#	(takes one look and sets off after Newman) Jeez!
4	#	Hey!
4	#	It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)
4	#	Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.
4	#	(Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These pants are fallin' apart, huh?
4	#	(Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, I was a different man then.
4	#	(Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, pre-teen, Swedish boy.
4	#	Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? Because if that's what you're sayin', Jerry, I'll go and I'll buy some jeans. (Jerry shrugs. Kramer raises his voice to a menacing tone) I swear to God I will! (Jerry's showing off a skeptical face.
4	#	Uh, yeah, I bought Dungarees.
4	#	Well, they're slim-fit.
4	#	(Talking fast) Yeah, they're streamlined.
4	#	(Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind him) Alright, see you later.
4	#	Jerry, you gotta help me!
4	#	I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be in costume!
4	#	(Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. It won't come off. The zipper's suck..
4	#	(Wiggling and floppin) Pull Down
4	#	(Feet off the ground, his body going everywhere on the couch) Wait, Jerry...Wait a minu...
4	#	(Getting Pulled and pulled) I...um...ei...
4	#	(Starts to tilt back onto the couch) You better get me. (Falls back and Jerry starts to him upright) Get me up, Get me up, Get me up.
4	#	(walking toward the door) Look I don't have time to wait, I'm gonna be late.
4	#	You better get the door.
4	#	Hey, sorry I'm late.
4	#	I know, it's a long story.
4	#	(takes a breath)
4	#	(still trying to sit down, says under his breath) I'm trying. {hard to make out}
4	#	Hey
4	#	Oh ya, I think they are starting to loosen up a bit. (Mrs. Anvino come to Jerry's threshold) Oh hi Mrs. Anvino.
4	#	Sure Mrs. Anvino, ya.
4	#	(salutes Jerry on his way out) See you later buddy.
4	#	(waddling after Joey) Joey! Joey!
4	#	(Going to the phone) I don't believe this
4	#	Mickey
4	#	Look, you gotta do me a favor.
4	#	Hey, you owe me. I got you into Actor's Studio. They thought what we did was the scene.
4	#	I gotta go find this kid. So all you gotta do is lay here, pretend you're asleep in case she gets back, here (grabs the covers and throws em over Mickey) keep the covers over ya.
4	#	I'm breaking them in, and they're feeling better.
4	#	Just keep the lights down and your eyes closed. I'll be back.
4	#	Joey, there you are. Hey
4	#	Joey
4	#	I'm the babysitter
4	#	No no look, I was baby-sitting
4	#	(somewhat under his breath) Ya ya.
4	#	Hey! George.....Lily..
4	#	No. No It's Lily
4	#	(lost for words) Well you look like a Lily...
4	#	Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. A periscope in a car, so you can see the traffic.
4	#	Huh! You make a higher roof.
4	#	why can't you make a higher roof.
4	#	Hey! Did you hear the bank on the corner is offering a 100 dollars if you go in there and they don't greet you with a hello?
4	#	Now what's with you?
4	#	Oh. Come on.
4	#	If a guy saved your life you'd be in love with him too.
4	#	What?
4	#	You stop it man.. you're FREAKING ME OUT!!!
4	#	Hey!
4	#	Hey! wait a second. You didn't say hello.
4	#	No no you didn't ...Hundred dollars.. I get a hundred dollars.
4	#	No, No You said Hey!
4	#	The add said that the bank's gonna pay a hundred dollars if you are not greeted with a hello
4	#	No, I want to speak to the manager.
4	#	Then I'll be back.
4	#	What are you talking about?
4	#	Why?
4	#	But she really looks like a Lily
4	#	Yeah. me neither.
4	#	No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks. I have to be unfettered.
4	#	All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want to get out of this thing ?
4	#	All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.
4	#	Ask her to sign a pre-nup.
4	#	Because most women when they're asked to sign a pre-nup are so offended they back out of the marriage.
4	#	Get out of here.
4	#	Jerry.... hey Jeannie.
4	#	Remember I told you about the bank?
4	#	Yeah well I went in there and they said Hey!
4	#	Oh! Big surprise ( he leaves frustrated)
4	#	Hey
4	#	Jeannie left?
4	#	Oh yeah! Well that's nice. I'm sure that's right up her alley.
4	#	Nothin'
4	#	No.
4	#	No
4	#	I don't like her.
4	#	That's right I don't like , I never like her from the get-go.
4	#	Everything she thinks. you think. Everything you think she thinks. No I can't take it. I can't take it Jerry. It's too much. It's too much.
4	#	So THAT's how it's going to be
4	#	OH! GOD HELP US!!!
4	#	Yeah. uh..I was in here the other day and I went up to that teller and he didn't say hello.
4	#	yeah., but he wouldn't give me the money.
4	#	(knocks on desk) Is thi oak?
4	#	Pine is good.
4	#	But that's not Hello.
4	#	Uhummm...
4	#	I'll take it.
4	#	Hey!! Frank just called me. Congratulations.
4	#	Look I'm sorry about before....I mean I'm sure I'll learn to like her, Jerry
4	#	C'mon , c'mon what's the matter?
4	#	Oh! Come on.
4	#	(mocking) Too bad you got engaged.
4	#	What happened?
4	#	Poor Lily..
4	#	Well that's weird
4	#	Movie?
4	#	No, no, no, I can't. I got my martial arts class.
4	#	(pronouncing it "kar-ah-tay") Karate, Jerry. Karate. The lifetime pursuit of balance and harmony.
4	#	Jerry, karate is not here (pointing to the ground). It's here (points to head), and here (points to chest), and here (makes a circle with his hands).
4	#	What, she's been away?
4	#	No, I really think you're wrong. We just went to the fireworks the other day.
4	#	Hey. (notices Elaine) What's wrong?
4	#	Where?
4	#	The discount pharmacy?
4	#	Whoa, whoa. Can't? When did that word enter your vocabulary? What, is the job too difficult? (Jerry nods) What, you don't have enough experience? (Jerry shakes his head) Oh, you're not smart enough? (Jerry shakes his head) Where's your confidence? (Jerry shrugs his shoulders) Look, Elaine, let me tell you a story. When I first studied karate...
4	#	Yeah, karate. I had no support. Not from him, not from Newman, no one. The first time I sparred with an opponent, I was terrified. My legs, they were like noodles. But then I looked inside, and I found my katra.
4	#	Yeah, your spirit, your, uh, being. The part of you that says, "Yes, I can!"
4	#	So I listened to my katra and now <vreep> I'm dominating the dojo. I'm class champion.
4	#	Sure you have.
4	#	You follow your katra, and you can do anything. (leads her to the door) Now get out of here.
4	#	That kid is gonna be all right.
4	#	Hey there.
4	#	Okay, Joey.
4	#	No, we're in the same class.
4	#	He almost beat me.
4	#	We're all at the same skill level, Jerry.
4	#	I got carpool. (exits)
4	#	Thanks for the juice box, Mrs. Z.
4	#	Oh, hey.
4	#	Oh, well, I-I-I'm dominating.
4	#	Well, it's not the size of the opponent, Elaine, it's, uh, the ferocity.
4	#	No, no. That's from, uh, Star Trek III... The Search for Spock.
4	#	Yeah, I know Jerry will tell you that The Wrath of Khan is the better picture, but for me, I always...
4	#	I thought you said your mom was meeting us in the alley.
4	#	What's going on? Hey, Timmy, Clara. That was some kind of workout we had tonight, huh?
4	#	Aah! Aah! Mama!
4	#	God!
4	#	Whew! I got whooped. You should have seen the rage in their little eyes. And those tiny little fists of fury. Oh. (notices the Urban Sombrero) What is that?
4	#	Oh I see. (Elaine walks up to him) Woof!
4	#	Well, then I was way off!
4	#	(with his forehead in his hands) Man, I gotta go lay down. You and George going out a little later?
4	#	You know, you oughta go down there and help him out. He's a widower.
4	#	I'm in trouble, buddy. I just met a woman.
4	#	Well, she's Jerry's girlfriend.
4	#	She works in a book shop. Her name is Pam.
4	#	I can't even speak in front of her. (Sits down on the couch.)
4	#	She has delicate beauty.
4	#	And yet, he's my friend.
4	#	Aw, that's beautiful, Newman.
4	#	I thought we were talking about me.
4	#	Confront Jerry? I can't.
4	#	I won't!
4	#	Yeah, I'll be okay.
4	#	Well, I'm sure he'll be sharing his next one with Pam.
4	#	What do you mean?
4	#	Jerry. Uh, can we talk?
4	#	I'd like to talk to Jerry in private.
4	#	Because it doesn't concern you.
4	#	It's Pam.
4	#	I love her, Jerry!
4	#	I love her!
4	#	Oh, she's uh...she's real. She can bring home the bacon and fry it in the pan.
4	#	Oh, and that voice!
4	#	Pam? Oh, it's a beautiful name. (Kramer sits on the couch.) Pam. Pam. Pam!
4	#	Oh, it's incredible. Although, I might replace her tortoise clip with one of those velvet scrunchies. I love those.
4	#	Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.
4	#	Oh, she's a dreamboat. But, you don't like her, so...
4	#	No you can't, Jerry.
4	#	Oh, no you don't.
4	#	What...?
4	#	Huh?
4	#	Huh-yah! (Kramer loses it and runs out past George, who is still sitting in the hallway on a chair.)
4	#	So now he wants her more than ever!
4	#	What am I gonna do, huh?
4	#	What, again with you?
4	#	If only I could say things like that around her.
4	#	Hi. How are you?
4	#	I too am well.
4	#	Do I smell?
4	#	Uh, Pantene.
4	#	Newman! (Elbows him through the books. Newman falls over.)
4	#	Uh, human. It's...human to be moved by a fragrance.
4	#	Her bouquet cleaved his hardened...
4	#	...shell. And fondled his muscled heart. He embibed her glistening spell...just before the other shoe...fell.
4	#	It's by an unknown 20th-century poet.
4	#	Newman. (On the other side of the bookcase, Newman preens proudly.)
4	#	I'm so happy! My world suddenly has meaning!
4	#	How can you have feelings for him? We're soul mates.
4	#	Jerry, you really think that Pam would want you to be the father of her children?
4	#	George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?
4	#	(frustrated) Wha??
4	#	(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.
4	#	You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)
4	#	(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)
4	#	You want a drink? I'm buyin'.
4	#	Hey buddy! Hey!
4	#	Breakfast. I gotta be in at Brand/Leland by nine.
4	#	Because I'm workin' there, that's why.
4	#	Jerry. I don't know if you've noticed, but lately, I've been drifting, aimlessly?
4	#	But I finally realized what's missing, in my life. Structure. An' at Brand/Leland, I'm gettin' things done. An' I love the people I'm workin' with.
4	#	Oh, no, no, no-no--I don't want any pay. I'm doin' this just for me.
4	#	T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.
4	#	(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.
4	#	(as he leaves with it) Crackers.
4	#	Wow. Man. What a day. Could I use a drink. (starts getting a drink and ice)
4	#	Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.
4	#	Yeah. Well, count me out. I'm swimmin'. Old man Leland is bustin' my hump over these reports. If I don't get 'em done by nine, I'm toast.. ((takes a swig and reacts))
4	#	Uh-huh.
4	#	Yeah..
4	#	That's nice..
4	#	Well, we're, talkin' now, aren't we?--
4	#	Oh here we go--
4	#	What are you starting with me for? You know this is my crazy time o' year?!
4	#	(grabs briefcase to leave) I gotta go to work. We'll talk about this later. (leaves)
4	#	Jerry. Hey Jerry?
4	#	Yeah, well, I got held up, you know. What happened to your hand?
4	#	The work piled up, I lost track of time--
4	#	You cooked?
4	#	(in pain) Ow! Jeez!
4	#	(Ow!) It's my stomach.
4	#	(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.
4	#	You got it, buddy.
4	#	Elaine!
4	#	What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?
4	#	Well, I ah.. been havin' trouble at home and uh.. I mean, ah, you know, I'll work harder, nights, weekends, whatever it takes..
4	#	Well, I'm uh, just--tryin' to get ahead..
4	#	I don't even really work here!
4	#	I wouldn't walk over there.
4	#	It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich.
4	#	I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab.
4	#	Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.
4	#	Don't really remember.
4	#	You get the tickets?
4	#	Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
4	#	Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me.
4	#	Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up?
4	#	There's no problem, really.
4	#	Brody's in.
4	#	Well, you better get on the horn.
4	#	There's Brody. Brody! Over here.
4	#	Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
4	#	All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera)
4	#	Relax, he does that all the time.
4	#	He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum?
4	#	But I want to--
4	#	Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.
4	#	It's a business.
4	#	He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco--
4	#	Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!
4	#	Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?
4	#	Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.
4	#	Jerry, if the man is in pain...
4	#	Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.
4	#	(To Brody) C'mon, let's go.
4	#	Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?
4	#	Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him!
4	#	He's quite a character, isn't he?
4	#	I got it. Yep.
4	#	Come on up. It's Brody.
4	#	Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you.
4	#	It's your first time. He'll understand.
4	#	Hey, Brody!
4	#	Uh yeah. It's under the couch.
4	#	Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh.
4	#	But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films.
4	#	Sure, do you need a glove?
4	#	(laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn)
4	#	That's fine.
4	#	It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
4	#	Wha? Where?
4	#	Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference.
4	#	So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum')
4	#	Right here. (Elaine enters)
4	#	(He shows her) This umpf thing.
4	#	No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.
4	#	You stink. (He exits)
4	#	I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy.
4	#	Jerry...
4	#	Jerry!
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!
4	#	Jerry, George got arrested.
4	#	Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him.
4	#	Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot?
4	#	Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)
4	#	Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again.
4	#	Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
4	#	Yeah, it's a disturbing image.
4	#	Well, I really miss the Bermuda Triangle.
4	#	Oh, there's action. There's plenty of action. That damned alien autopsy is stealing all the headlines.
4	#	See, what they gotta do is loose a plane or a Greenpeace boat in there. See, that would get the triangle going again.
4	#	What would be the point in taking the water?
4	#	No. It belongs to the British.
4	#	So, what do you think about that alien autopsy?
4	#	I think so too.
4	#	Hey, you got to get this thing fixed.
4	#	Would you like a refund?
4	#	Would you be interested?
4	#	Would you?
4	#	Yeah, yeah.
4	#	I I I
4	#	Well hello Photo store Sheila.
4	#	No, no. Your not playing the game.
4	#	She goes to these lengths to entice you and your only response is " Gee I really like your picture. Would you like to go out on a date with me please. "
4	#	George. It's the timeless art of seduction. You got to join in the dance. She sends you an enticing photo, you send her one right back.
4	#	Well as you know I've always been something of a photog.
4	#	Hey you got it.
4	#	That's right. Now it looks like it was broken during shipping and I insured it for $400.
4	#	You can't get a refund. Your warranty expired two years ago.
4	#	It's just a write off for them.
4	#	They just write it off.
4	#	Jerry all these big companies they write off everything
4	#	Do you?
4	#	But they do and they are the ones writing it off.
4	#	Oh yeah. Elaine was a fun project. I enjoyed working with her.
4	#	Uh no. Look at this. Okay yeah this looks good and I like what your wearing.
4	#	No, no. You're stoked. The camera loves stokedness. Look were not going to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. The key word is tasteful. Now I want you to relax and have fun because your a fun guy. All right let's do it. Okay come on. Feel the beat. Feel the beat. You know you got some real strong pecks but it's hard to tell under that T-shirt.
4	#	I don't know it's up to you.
4	#	It might be. I mean whatever you want.
4	#	That's it George. Come on, come on. Give it to me. Come on,work it. Work it. Yeah be a man, be a man.
4	#	You are a lover boy!!
4	#	Mail fraud. Your in a lot of trouble buddy.
4	#	Yeah let me borrow your scarf.
4	#	Yeah. All right one chart coming up.
4	#	Bennette right?
4	#	I like what you've done with that.
4	#	Yes, yes. I am Dr. Vanostran from the clinic. I need Elaine Benes chart. She's a patient of mine and she's not going to make it. It's uh very bad very messy.
4	#	That's correct.
4	#	From The Hoffer-Mandale Clinic in Belgium.
4	#	The Netherlands?
4	#	No.
4	#	I don't know. But now they got a chart on me.
4	#	Yowza yowza. Check it out.
4	#	I expect you both to be there.
4	#	Well neither am I.
4	#	I'm not, I'm running it.
4	#	Well Lomez, he usually runs it but he's in the Everglades.
4	#	Oh yeah yeah yeah. Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.
4	#	Yeah, Frank Costanza, he's getting me a room at his lodge. So Jerry, you know I'm really counting on you to come to this.
4	#	No, Jerry, look I'm cooking all the food myself.
4	#	Do you like tsimmis?
4	#	Well, he came by to pick up his check for the banquet hall. You know I got a hundred and eighty-three responses? Oh, it's gonna be a rager.
4	#	Yeah, you're right. That's a lot of pupkitz. Hey Frank, you know anybody who can help me cook?
4	#	What's the matter with him?
4	#	Shell-shocked?
4	#	I got three kitchens going. I got brisket going at Newman's, I got kugel working at Mrs. Zamfino's, this is kreplach. Here, try some of this.
4	#	Eat, eat! You're skin and bones.
4	#	Hah?
4	#	Jerry, it's kreplach. It's an acquired taste, yeah.
4	#	The recipe was for four to six people; I had to multiply for a hundred and eighty-three people. I guess I got confused.
4	#	Well I also dropped it on the way over. Look I'm in trouble, I got no skills. I can't peel, I can't chop, I can't grate. I can't mince! I got no sense of flavor, obviously. You know, I gotta talk to Frank.
4	#	No I gotta talk to him, I know that he can help me, Jerry.
4	#	My stuffed cabbage!
4	#	C'mon Frank, I need you. I mean the war was fifty years ago.
4	#	Alright, what happened, Frank? What is it that you can't get over?
4	#	What happened?
4	#	Frank, you were a boy too. And it was war. It was a crazy time for everyone.
4	#	Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred Jewish singles need you. This is your chance to make it all right again.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Oh yeah, come on in, Frank.
4	#	Keflon.
4	#	Ya know these latkes are going like hotcakes.
4	#	You know Frank, you could take a break.
4	#	Hey. Well. (proffers the envelope) This was downstairs for you. Ker-ching.
4	#	Oh, you didn't hear? Jerry's a big star in Japan.
4	#	Yeah, the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
4	#	Hey, Jerry, you need any new furniture?
4	#	(getting a bottle of water out of the fridge) Yeah, well, Elaine's new boyfriend, you know. He's giving me this oversize chest of drawers. It's a Farbman.
4	#	Oh, no, no, no. Not the Sunshine Carpet Cleaners?
4	#	They're a crazy religious cult. The carpet cleaning is just a means for them to get into your apartment.
4	#	Hello, twelve dollars.
4	#	(takes camera) Oh, yeah, sure.
4	#	(to tourists) Hey, are you folks from Japan.
4	#	(points over to Jerry) You recognise that mug?
4	#	That's the funny face that greets you at the beginning of the Super Terrific Happy Hour.
4	#	Ah, yeah. Yeah, that's him.
4	#	Well, I don't know. But something super terrific, I'm sure.
4	#	Oh yeah, very funny. And it wouldn't be impolite to laugh at his antics.
4	#	Yeah. Yeah, that's it. Because everybody laughs at Jerry here in America.
4	#	(reads) Three hundred dollars. Hey, Mr Oh, how much would these run you in Tokyo?
4	#	(shocked) Thirty thousand?! These are practically free.
4	#	Giddyup. You're a cowboy now.
4	#	Konichi-wa. Yeah, it's a gift from my Japanese friends. (sits beside Jerry) They're known as gift-givers. And tonight we're going dancing at the Rainbow Room.
4	#	Well, Jerry, they're Japanese. I mean, that TV you watch, that sushi you eat, I mean, even that kimono you wear. Where to you think all that money goes, hmm?
4	#	That's right.
4	#	Well, they recognised Jerry from the Super Terrific Happy Hour. See now, you should be doing your own show in Japan. Now, they get you.
4	#	(to George) Alright, what'd you do with that pilot you did.
4	#	That's right, I think that had marvellous production values.
4	#	George is right, Jerry. See, here, you're just another apple, but in Japan, you're an exotic fruit. Like an orange. Which is rare there.
4	#	(to Jerry) Hey, man.
4	#	Uh, well, we, uh, we had to leave early. There was a, uh, slight monetary discrepancy regarding the bill.
4	#	Uh, listen, uh, can I borrow some pillows?
4	#	Well, I'm sorry, Jerry, we all don't have checks rolling in like you do.
4	#	Well, they ran out of it. Manhattan can be quite pricey. Even with fifty thousand yen.
4	#	Evidently. (To Elaine) Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them.
4	#	Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home.
4	#	(smiling) Oh yeah, yeah.
4	#	Goodnight, Mr Tanaka.
4	#	Goodnight, Mr Oh.
4	#	Goodnight, Mr Yamaguchi.
4	#	Rice Crispies. East meets West, Jerry.
4	#	(opening the fridge) Sayonara.
4	#	Here you go. Snap, crackle and pop.
4	#	(loudly) Good morning, Mr Oh. I gotta make up the drawer.
4	#	Hey, George. How about that tour, huh? These guys are ready to run the bases.
4	#	(quietly) Ah, listen, George, what else can I do with these guys? Now, bear in mind, they're a little light on the yen.
4	#	(snaps his fingers) That's perfect. (to the Japanese) Hey, how would you guys like to watch Super Terrific Happy star Jerry Seinfeld?
4	#	Oh, yeah, yeah. (feeds tape into VCR) Well, you guys just watch the tape and, uh, I'll get you some food.
4	#	(shouts) Hey, peanuts!
4	#	Heyy! Look who's here.
4	#	(beckoning to George) Come on, I want you to come in here.
4	#	There you are.
4	#	Uh, no, I let 'em sleep in.
4	#	I'm on my way to cash in their plane tickets for them. They need a little food money.
4	#	No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub.
4	#	Awe check it out.
4	#	Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken places on every block.
4	#	Well, (rubs hands) I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him pick out a turtle.
4	#	Yea, yea.
4	#	What?
4	#	Oh the red. Yeah, Its the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.
4	#	They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.
4	#	Yeah, he was fired.
4	#	Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)
4	#	Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.
4	#	Getting some cereal
4	#	That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it.  I gotta move in with you Jerry.
4	#	Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?
4	#	Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!
4	#	I may have to drive that place out of business.
4	#	Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.
4	#	Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.
4	#	Jerry Im so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.
4	#	What, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.
4	#	Well I'm boycotting it.
4	#	What is that, hickory?
4	#	Really?
4	#	Oh stop it. (he slaps Newmans shoulder) Whats the matter with you.
4	#	Mmmmm.
4	#	You should sleep with him.
4	#	Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)
4	#	That was a close one.
4	#	Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.
4	#	So Heather called?
4	#	No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)
4	#	Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.
4	#	I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?
4	#	Hmm. That's a shame.
4	#	Newman, what took you... ah hey, hey
4	#	Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.
4	#	Oh
4	#	(laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...
4	#	... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.
4	#	Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.
4	#	Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.
4	#	No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.
4	#	Oh I got a big problem Jerry!
4	#	(his mouth is very full) Kenny? ... Kenny?
4	#	(quietly and staring across the street) Kenny .... Kenny ....... Kenny
4	#	Hey, buddy. How was career day?
4	#	They're trying to screw with your head.
4	#	Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number when you buy batteries? I don't know.
4	#	No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)
4	#	Come on, Larry. You know me.
4	#	What, did they kick you out too?
4	#	Hey, you got any matches?
4	#	Thanks. (Kramer leaves, phone rings)
4	#	Ashtrays?
4	#	Ooh, cereal bowls.
4	#	All right, thanks. (Kramer leaves)
4	#	Need some more matches.
4	#	I met some people smoking on the street, so I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.
4	#	Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.
4	#	Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter section. (Jerry enters) Hey.
4	#	Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. (Katie enters)
4	#	Hey buddy.
4	#	Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe night.
4	#	What? (Kramer checks it out.) My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.
4	#	Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood. Everything I have I owe to this face.
4	#	Look away, I'm hideous.
4	#	Jackie we gotta talk.
4	#	But Jackie--
4	#	Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco companies.
4	#	The tobacco companies.
4	#	No, it didn't say anything.
4	#	So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?
4	#	Who could love me?
4	#	Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.
4	#	It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.
4	#	Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called me. We had a little pow-wow.
4	#	She made an offer. I took it.
4	#	No, no, no. There was no money.
4	#	Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard with Kramer on it)
4	#	Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture of germs being in the air)
4	#	Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.
4	#	Yeah, and I rented out half that space to Newman. (Starts coughing again)
4	#	(Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.
4	#	(Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the kitchen)
4	#	Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the food)
4	#	(Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line.. (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so Elaine can't hear) Plus, the botched my vasectimy.
4	#	(Complaining) I'm even more potent now!
4	#	(Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket. (Makes a clicking sound with his tongue)
4	#	it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales of the Sea" 51 people died.
4	#	There were 1,650 survivors.
4	#	Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear Attacks"
4	#	Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it. (Leaves)
4	#	Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you got there, huh?
4	#	(Between coughs) Hey.
4	#	(Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers. I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)
4	#	(Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.
4	#	Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day. They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops snapping) - all on the same day.
4	#	(Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.
4	#	Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh.. dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's worse - he has a nagging cough. (Smucker's coughs) Yeah, that's it. That's it.
4	#	(Offended) What? No. That's disgusting..
4	#	Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket) I got some pilss. They taste terrible.
4	#	(Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too tender.
4	#	I don't want to!
4	#	(Squirming) Jerry! What?!
4	#	(Struggling) Hey!
4	#	Whe have the same symptoms.
4	#	No, no. No doctors.
4	#	Where are you going?
4	#	I don't know..
4	#	I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the way to the park! (Starts getting even more energetic) Where are we going?.. I recognize this block! (Looks at Jerry, scared) You're taking me to the doctor!
4	#	No, Jerry!
4	#	No! Don't!
4	#	So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.
4	#	Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all the other bad checks.
4	#	That's caged heat.
4	#	Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.
4	#	Yes! These are sweatshop eggs.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	What's up?
4	#	Oh? What's she in for? (putting groceries in the fridge)
4	#	Well, not here.
4	#	Okay (lifting the bag and carrying it into the apt.)
4	#	Well, it's chicken feed. (Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.)
4	#	Yeah, I bought a chicken.
4	#	Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.
4	#	No (throws hand in the air and turns and looks back at Jerry)
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Oh, Jerry loves the morning.
4	#	Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
4	#	Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
4	#	Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.
4	#	Yeah (quietly)
4	#	Yeah (again quietly)
4	#	Ah, well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.
4	#	Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?
4	#	Hey, hey Jerry, come on. Sorry.
4	#	Oh yeah (quietly)
4	#	Yeah, Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
4	#	Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.
4	#	Yeah, so he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.
4	#	Only in The United States.
4	#	No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.
4	#	What?
4	#	Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like "American Gladiators."
4	#	Yeah, well, I left him with Marcelino!
4	#	My Little Jerry! (Runs out.)
4	#	Oh well, he's more than O.K., he won!
4	#	Yeah, well I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight lasted two seconds.
4	#	Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down today.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.
4	#	Who?
4	#	Well, that's out of the question.
4	#	Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!
4	#	You know, I think you're jealous.
4	#	Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than you ever will! Yah-yah! (Kramer leaves.)
4	#	O.K.!
4	#	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy he's lookin' good, huh Jerry?
4	#	I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little Jerry.
4	#	Ohh, He's got a big sweat going. (Takes an envelope out of his pocket.) Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.
4	#	There's Marcelino. (Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge white rooster.)
4	#	That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
4	#	Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him outta there.
4	#	Ahhh, uh, uh, uh, ohuh, aaaa ouh au au au ah ah (more pecking) ah, ah, ah, Ah.
4	#	Well, that was alright, huh?
4	#	Well, um, goodnight.
4	#	(quietly, to himself) Look at this.
4	#	(to Jerry) Man, that Emily is wearing me out.
4	#	No, no, no. It's not the sex, Jerry. (noticing Morty and Helen) Heyy! Seinfelds.
4	#	Oh yeah? What about?
4	#	What'd you get for it?
4	#	Yeah, that def jam is a force.
4	#	Y'know you've given this comedy thing your best shot. Yeah, you had some good observations, but it's over. Now, this Bloomingdale thing, that could be the next wave.
4	#	Elaine. Uh, you got a moment?
4	#	I, uh, need to speak to you about some lady problems.
4	#	(a little anxious) You know, after I have sex with Emily, uh, I don't want her in the bed any more.
4	#	Yeah, because she's throwing off my whole sleep. She's got the jimmy legs.
4	#	Jimmy leg.
4	#	So, uh, well, maybe I should just be honest with her, huh?
4	#	Well, I'd say it nicely.
4	#	Well, you know, I really like this girl and I, you know, I think if I could just work out this one thing...
4	#	Well you're not exactly zeroing in yourself, lady.
4	#	Shh, shh.
4	#	Oh yeah, like strawberry pie.
4	#	I know it's not what the ladies like. But without some solid sack time, I'm a zombie.
4	#	(pleading) Aww, c'mon, man. Meet me halfway.
4	#	I know.
4	#	Hey, where's Jerry?
4	#	Aw, okay. (picks up the phone and starts dialling) Yeah, I need his shoeshine kit. (still dialling) He always hides it from me. (puts the phone to his ear and waits for a second or two) Yeah, Bally's? Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld's room, please.
4	#	I used to have a problem. (into phone) Well, what d'you mean, he's not registered? Wha..S, E, I, N, V...
4	#	...F, E, L, D. (half-laughing) Well, I think you're wrong. (listens) Alright, you have a lucky day, too.
4	#	No, they never heard of him.
4	#	That was alright.
4	#	(abruptly) Well, I'll see you.
4	#	(hesitant) I uh, I was thinking maybe I should spend the night.
4	#	(surprise) What?
4	#	I do?
4	#	(fearful) There was a man, he was trying to get into my apartment last night. He was jiggling the doorknob for twenty-five minutes.
4	#	No, no, no. It was a fearless cat burglar. (pleading) Now listen, you gotta let me sleep here, huh? Y'know, I'll stay here on my side, and I'll stuff a sock in my mouth. (panicky) 'Cos I don't wanna sleep alone.
4	#	Mornin'.
4	#	Oh, boy.
4	#	I had some trouble at my place, so I need a little company at night to sleep.
4	#	Uh, George, your parents can't blow through their savings in this community. It's low-rent. Now, we feel that Florida is really the place where they should be.
4	#	Hey Frank, you got two beds in here.
4	#	So, you sleep in separate beds.
4	#	(intrigued) Really?
4	#	You can get that in your arms?
4	#	Oh, yeah, yeah. I got Emily coming over tonight.
4	#	I don't know why I let you talk me into that corned beef at Snitzer's.
4	#	(dismissive) Yeah.
4	#	(moody) Oh, why do I have to go? They're your friends.
4	#	I've had it with 'em.
4	#	(yielding) Okay, okay. What time?
4	#	(satisfied) Ahh. That was alright.
4	#	Checking out the staff picks, Miss Benes?
4	#	Oh, Vincent is an art-house goon. I stick to the Gene rack.
4	#	(indicates 'Gene' shelf) I've seen all these, so I went with a Kramer pick.
4	#	Yeah, went straight to video.
4	#	(positive) That makes me the premiere.
4	#	Jerry, have you ever seen the movie The Other Side Of Darkness?
4	#	It's about this woman, in a coma. Well, I couldn't finish watching it, so I want you to read this.
4	#	Can you do that for me, buddy?
4	#	Well, I'm gonna type it up.
4	#	Yeah, but, Jackie Chiles, he put a restraining order on me. (frustrated) I'm not allowed within two hundred feet of his office. I couldn't even give him his Christmas present.
4	#	Oh, hey, new racquet, huh?
4	#	(picking up Jerry's old racquet) Well, you're not gonna need this any more.
4	#	(explaining) Oh yeah, I put all your zees on the weights and measures page.
4	#	Hey. Right, I talked to this lawyer guy, Shellbach. Now, he's gonna set me up, but you gotta come with me and be the executor.
4	#	I don't wanna be a vegetable, Elaine. I just want out. (snaps fingers)
4	#	Look, just tell him you had sex with his wife. That'll kill him.
4	#	Look, George, just think about it. You know, you're married, how would you feel if somebody says to you that they just had se...
4	#	(picking the racquet up) Did you take this out of the garbage?
4	#	Oh, Jerry, this is a piece of junk. (drops racquet in the trash) How are you gonna be the executor of my living will?
4	#	(indicating) You see? You can't let go.
4	#	I wish I could believe you. Hey, Elaine, do you have some free time tomorrow afternoon?
4	#	Yeah, because you're perfect. You're a calculating, cold-hearted businesswoman. And when there's dirty work to be done, you don't mind stomping on a few throats.
4	#	Well, would I be able to communicate?
4	#	Huhh, yeah, let's pull the cord.
4	#	Well, I gotta have a central nervous system.
4	#	Naw, that's not my style.
4	#	(hesitant) Uhm...
4	#	Yeah, yeah. Stick. (to Elaine) 'Cos I could still go to the coffee shop.
4	#	That's a lotta yearning, huh?
4	#	Yeah, well, what you need is some summertime adolescent high jinx.
4	#	(looking at 'Gene' rack) See what doctor Gene prescribes, huh? (pulls down a cassette) Oh, here, look at that. Weekend At Bernies Two. Now, that's an hilarious premise.
4	#	Yeah. (taps the Weekend At Bernie's II box)
4	#	(approving) Yeah.
4	#	Nothing, I'm gonna finish watching The Other Side Of Darkness.
4	#	Yeah, about two hours.
4	#	Yeah, she shot in that coma pretty quick.
4	#	Hey. Oh, Jerry, listen uh, you know, I saw the rest of that movie, The Other Side Of Darkness? The coma lady wakes up at the end.
4	#	I didn't know it was possible to come out of a coma.
4	#	(shouting back) Oh, unforgettable.
4	#	(nervous) I gotta find Elaine. Y'know, she's gonna pull my plug.
4	#	Yeah, listen, uh, Elaine, I've changed my mind about the whole coma thing. (positive) Yeah, I decided I'm up for it.
4	#	(indicating that cars should pass him) Well, go around, you bunch of crazies. You maniacs are gonna get us all killed.
4	#	Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm Cosmo Kramer. Yeah, I had an appointment to annul my living will.
4	#	(waving) Shellbach.
4	#	Racquet.
4	#	(screaming) Waahhh!!!
4	#	Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?
4	#	Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, yum!
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto a pizza) and what-not.. mmm, mmm.. and I see this guy over at the pizza boxes giving me the stink-eye. (Imitates the 'stink-eye') So I give hime the crook-eye back, (Imitates the 'crook-eye') you know.. Then, I notice that he's not alone! I'm taking on the entire Van Buren Boys!
4	#	Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, I lunged for the bathroom. (demonstrates) I grab the knob - Occupado! Then they back me up agains the cartoon map of Italy, and all of the sudden, they just stop.
4	#	Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing eight fingers.
4	#	That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van B. Boy!
4	#	And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th President, was the man they most admired.
4	#	You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his tongue)
4	#	My whole lot?
4	#	(Thinks) 1500 dollars.
4	#	(Excited) Done!
4	#	Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)
4	#	Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off to the store.
4	#	Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer) So I'm waiting for the subway, It's not coming, so I decided to hoof it through the tunnel.
4	#	Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but the next think I knew..
4	#	No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants I was about to return.
4	#	Well, I guess I was..
4	#	Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses) All right, next story..
4	#	Yeah, yeah, chew on that.
4	#	Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..
4	#	Elaine, you should be there to document it.
4	#	Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple a chance to loosen up.
4	#	(To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get my thoughts together.
4	#	(Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer - gesturing that he's right on target)
4	#	(Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive training program for him.
4	#	Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.
4	#	Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.
4	#	All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh, everybody's wrong but you!
4	#	Which one?
4	#	Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey, Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically) Real au jus sauce!
4	#	Yeah?
4	#	Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone, and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)
4	#	What do ya mean?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	But I did sit in mud.
4	#	(Pleading) I was all dirty!
4	#	(To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well.. Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided I wasn't gonna return them! (Laughs) Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
4	#	What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches his friends leave)
4	#	(Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the - with the Van Buren Boys.
4	#	Hey, now, they're tough cookies.
4	#	Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly don't have any stories, if that's what you're implying. (Laughs heartily)
4	#	Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me, but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.
4	#	Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my cold cuts on the couch next to me, but as I'm stacking them up, they keep falling into my foot bath! (Jerry and Elaine look disgusted)
4	#	Damn!
4	#	Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but they all stink!
4	#	Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling out "Newman!")
4	#	Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!
4	#	Yippie-yi-yay!
4	#	Look how dark it's gettin' already.
4	#	When does it start?
4	#	Uh. Well, I'm sick o' waiting. (pulls out his pocket-watch (it has a chain, too)) I am springin' ahead riiight now.
4	#	Oh now, don't tell me you're still mad at him for calling you a phony. Jerry, that was five years ago!
4	#	Hey! Mike!
4	#	(quickly) Ah no no no. No bets for me, I uh, I got a disease.
4	#	You kidding? It's all water near a bridge.
4	#	(pulling out his timepiece) Oh yes. Uh.. it's aaalmost six.
4	#	(suddenly entering) Hey, oh--listen. Did you get my ticket from Allison--
4	#	All right! Yeah.. Courtside.. Whoa! Don't let this girl get away..
4	#	(All right.) (to Jerry) Ah? Oh, by the way you owe Mike a hundred dollars.
4	#	Well I put a bet down for ya on tonight's game. Yeah, if the Knicks beat the Pacers by more than thirty-five? It pays ten to one. Oo-oo! That's some sweet action!
4	#	Well, I couldn't do it I got a gamblin' problem.
4	#	(impatient sigh) You don't have a problem.
4	#	(comes in, subdued) Hey. (grabs a water from refrigerator)
4	#	No. I was kicked out for fightin' with one of the players. (leaving)
4	#	(stops) W--Reggie Miller.
4	#	Yeah. (leaving)
4	#	(stops again) Well, first of all, for some reason, they started the game an hour Late. And uh, I was sittin' next to Spike Lee an' he an' Reggie were jawin' at each other, so I guess I got involved. (leaving)
4	#	(stops again) Well I.. ran out onto the court an' threw a hotdog at Reggie Miller. "Involved." An' they threw meee, an' Reggie, an' Spike out o' the game.
4	#	Well I, well I, felt, pretty bad about everything an' uh, then the three of us, we went to a strip club. (leaves)
4	#	(suddenly comes back, excited) The Knicks killed 'em a hundred an' ten to seventy three!
4	#	No, Jerry--that's thirty-seven points! The Knicks covered! You won! See, that's a cooool-G, Daddy-O--now you gotta let it riiiide!
4	#	(real addict) Ah, come-on, Jerry--I don't wanna lose this feeling. Hey--let's go down to the O.T.B. We'll put some money on the ponies. (getting out pocket-watch)
4	#	(looking at watch) Ssssh--ah! They just closed!
4	#	Allison. Hi. Uh--listen I'm really sorry about what happened at the game last night. Listen--could I have a ticket tonight--'cause the Rockets are in town an' that, Hakeem Olajuwon? Ohhh--he's got a real attitude.
4	#	Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, he--uh--visits the guy across the hall from me like every ten minutes.
4	#	(quiet, delicately) Allison spoke to me, and um. She wanted me to speak to you.
4	#	We all know that this relationship isn't working. So Allison an' I think that the best thing to do is just.. make a, clean break.
4	#	(reasoning) We just don't think you're ready for a serious relationship!
4	#	(dismayed) So what am I in this for? You know, I'm getting to a point in my life where I need something more than just.. a good time. (is tearing up)
4	#	Wha--me? No! No. But she is.
4	#	George, we're sorry.
4	#	(leaves, upset) Waaa-aa--aa! I'm sorry--
4	#	Mike's outside. He wants to talk to you.
4	#	Because he's scared, Jerry.
4	#	(sighs, opens door) Come on in. Did you do this? (Mike has two hand casts on)
4	#	Uh--ah--ah! You broke his thumbs.
4	#	Oh, is that what you call it when, Somebody doesn't Pay Up?
4	#	Nuh! Okay Jerry, how about if Mike fixes your truuunk, we call it even, an' this way, nobody has to get hurt.
4	#	See that was nice, Jerry. (under breath) Oh, by the way, I'm the one who broke your trunk.
4	#	(looking down, nodding) Hi.
4	#	Yeah, yeah..
4	#	Ooo, yeah.. (indicating his face, embarrassed) (Heh, right.) You know, it's gettin' kind of late, I, I really have to be going, so, uh, it's nice seeing you again, all right--
4	#	George, it's over. It's just.. It's Over. (leaves)
4	#	(opens door) Uh--George, uh--uh--it's five o'clock in the morning, what's the matter with you..
4	#	Huh?
4	#	Oh. Oh, George.
4	#	(regretfully) Uh.. I know I'm gonna regret this. (sigh) All right.
4	#	All right, all right, I'll see ya later. (shuts door)
4	#	(happy, enthused) We're takin' George back--
4	#	He's gonna make us very happy.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Oh, Allison, she didn't want to come.
4	#	Well, yeah, I did, but she's a tough nut. How d'ya like the tuxedo. It's a rental but I've had it for fifteen years. All right, eh. (heading in)
4	#	The Ball, silly.
4	#	George. I thought you were gonna Change.
4	#	(light admonishing, under breath) Let's just try, an' have a nice time for once, an' we'll talk about this when we get home..
4	#	Oh, I'm with him.
4	#	Hey. Look at this. I'm in the passing lane of the Arthur Berkhardt expressway, going seventy and (makes impact sound - pckergh!) Dragged this thing for five exits.
4	#	Well I was draughting behind a semi. I didn't wanna lose him. The infrastructure, Jerry, it's crumbling.
4	#	Well, look at that. A talking Nixon.
4	#	Well, I'm a poppa.
4	#	(handing Jerry a cigar) Well, as of today I am a proud parent of a one-mile stretch of the Arthur Berkhardt Expressway.
4	#	Yeah, I'm part of the solution now Jerry. Yeah, I went down there and I checked it out this morning. Here, take a look. Mile one-fourteen.
4	#	Aw, I'm beaming Jerry.
4	#	They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.
4	#	Yeah, well that's why I'm doing it all myself. This parenting isn't about delegating responsibility, it's about being there.
4	#	Quality time.
4	#	C'mon, retrace your steps. What d'you do today?
4	#	Right.
4	#	Sure you can. (to Jerry) Such a sweet kid.
4	#	(shouting after car) Hey Jerry! Yeah, I'll see you back at the house!
4	#	Mile one-fourteen, clean as a whistle.
4	#	Hey, you should see the Berkhardt, Jerry. My mile is spotless. I mean the big stuff was easy. Cinderblocks, air-conditioners, shopping carts (makes sound - fzup!), I just rolled 'em into the woods.
4	#	(holding up a sign) Speed limit, one hundred and sixty-five miles per hour. See? They slipped a one in there. (laughing) Those kids with the spray paint, God love 'em.
4	#	Hey, you need some roadwork done? 'Cos I met some maintenance guys today on the highway, they could probably help you out.
4	#	Oh yeah, yeah. I borrowed some cones from them when I was sweeping my car-pool lane.
4	#	Oh yeah, yeah. Give me a ring tomorrow. I'm gonna be at emergency callbox seven-eight-four.
4	#	I need the yield sign.
4	#	You could've introduced me.
4	#	Hey ah.
4	#	Oh, I'm making a difference Jerry.
4	#	You should see the smiles on the drivers' faces. I mean, you gotta look quick, but they're there.
4	#	Well, you know, those annoying little bumps on the lane-lines? (makes noise - bum, bum, bum, bum, bump)
4	#	Well, I had to pull 'em up if I'm gonna widen the lanes.
4	#	Ah, you know how in planes they got first class? More leg room, better ride? Well, I'm bringing that concept to mile one-fourteen.
4	#	Well you black out lane-lines one and three, and a four-lane highway becomes a two-lane comfort cruise. (to Jerry) So, you got any black paint?
4	#	That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.
4	#	Well, Newman uses his mail truck to run fish for China Panda on the weekends.
4	#	Now, where's that tool shed of yours?
4	#	Huh, yeah. (looks round) Oh, sweet setup. Elaine, d'you have any paint thinner? I need like uh, forty gallons.
4	#	Oh man, if I don't get that black paint off the City's gonna go ape. I don't wanna lose my baby!
4	#	(holding up a set of heavy chains) I'm gonna borrow this, huh?
4	#	Bugger!
4	#	Double bugger!
4	#	Hey buddy. What're you doing out here?
4	#	Man, did you see that fireball? Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo.
4	#	Hey, I gotta skedaddle. You wanna lift?
4	#	Newman! Newman!!
4	#	Well, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
4	#	Look what I got for you, for your Florida trip. Crazy Shirts was closing 'em out. I got a dozen for a buck.
4	#	Saved a fortune. Look at that. Heyy.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Okay, look, uh, when you're in Florida, can my cigar guy drop off some Cubans for me at your parents' house?
4	#	Aw, c'mon man. Help a brother out.
4	#	Yeahh. I owe you one.
4	#	Yeah, hello, Jerry's place.
4	#	I said Cubans. What'd you think I meant?
4	#	Jerry, Cuban cigars are illegal in this country. That's why I got these guys.
4	#	Yeah, yeah. I got investors all lined up.
4	#	Hot and spicy.
4	#	Yes I am.
4	#	Damn!
4	#	Jerry, I just picked up the Cubans at the bus station. (shrill) What's going on!?
4	#	(animated) They're not real Cubans. They're Dominicans.
4	#	So, Jerry, if my investors don't get Cubans, the whole deal's off.
4	#	Jerry, once you've had real Cubans, there's just nothing else like it.
4	#	Yes, yes. The quality, the texture, the intoxicating aroma. These guys don't have it.
4	#	Jerry, your palate's unrefined.
4	#	Is too.
4	#	Is too.
4	#	Are too.
4	#	Are too.
4	#	Are too.
4	#	(nervous) Okay, well, uh, I'll uh, I'll get the Cubans.
4	#	They're right out here.
4	#	Hey, here they are. The Cubans. Real Cubans.
4	#	(fidgety) Oh, now, come on. Look at these boys. If they were any more Cuban, Castro would've smoked them himself. Huh.
4	#	(puzzled) I think so.
4	#	Well, yeah, yeah. But they also rolled for his brother... (thinks for a second) ...Dennis.
4	#	Uh, Dwayne.
4	#	(shrill) What!?
4	#	(quietly) Hey, Jerry.
4	#	(noise - like shivery) Datiditadit.
4	#	No. (indicates with his head) (noise again) Ditadidatidat.
4	#	(indicating with his thumb) Dijadidatjd. There.
4	#	(urgent) No, no. Don't look. Don't look.
4	#	Over there. The Dominicans.
4	#	Well, it didn't quite work out, and now I've got nothing for them to do.
4	#	So, I taught 'em all about Cuba, and they really took to it. You know, Marxism, the Worker's Revolution, the clothing.
4	#	(nervous) Yeah. I'm a little worried. When there's no work, and the people get restless, who do you think they come after? (pointing to himself, shrill) El Presidente!
4	#	These Dominicans really know their way round a crepe. Look at that. It's like they're rolling a double corona.
4	#	(to one of the guys) Just a cigar made outta bisquik, huh, Guillermo?
4	#	(looks over at the three guys) The Dominicans are rolling them too tight. (regretful) Uhm, well, that's why you gotta get real Cubans.
4	#	No, pool. I just swam 200 laps.
4	#	Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going up to oyur place.
4	#	Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.
4	#	got problems Jerry.
4	#	Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through a flabby armed spanking machine.
4	#	A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't hold me, Jerry.
4	#	What's that guy's last name again?
4	#	Oh, that's right.
4	#	Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's see if it will fit in my bedroom.
4	#	My old one sprung a leak.
4	#	Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.
4	#	Jer.
4	#	Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself miles and miles of open lanes.
4	#	That's East River.
4	#	Technically Norfok has more gross tonnage.
4	#	I saw a couple of other guys out there.
4	#	Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.
4	#	Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.
4	#	Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. I think it might be polluted.
4	#	It is very obtrusive.
4	#	You can't get a stool in here.
4	#	No, that's no good. I'm leaving.
4	#	Oh, hey,
4	#	Hal, .. uh Langerhans.
4	#	Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right
4	#	Oh, I'm jiff.
4	#	Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.
4	#	Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .
4	#	That's it.
4	#	Oh, we go back a ways.
4	#	That's right.
4	#	No, no. She put a stop to that.
4	#	Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the back.
4	#	Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.
4	#	What's going on?
4	#	He just sunk like a stone.
4	#	Hey, watch where you're kicking!
4	#	Elaine
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or Mickey?
4	#	Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
4	#	Well, you too seem to have the same taste.
4	#	Well I have the same shirt.
4	#	Oh. (Waiter approaches table)
4	#	I live for Merlot.
4	#	I don't believe that.
4	#	Why were you holding the door open for?
4	#	Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was wrong!
4	#	I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just take the one that was on the left?
4	#	Oh, everybody's your type.
4	#	You've been married three times.
4	#	Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!
4	#	All right, so we let the girls decide.
4	#	Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.
4	#	That's right, 'cause they already saw it.
4	#	What are they doing here?
4	#	All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?
4	#	All right, I'll take Julie.
4	#	All right, I'll take Karen.
4	#	All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. (Continue to struggle)
4	#	Well, I gotta do somethin'.
4	#	(Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.
4	#	I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be Karen.
4	#	Hi.
4	#	Got a minute?
4	#	Sure.
4	#	Hi.
4	#	So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)
4	#	No, Julie. She's the one.
4	#	Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know her parents are little people?
4	#	Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, Jerry.
4	#	Those people, listen to yourself.
4	#	You think that dentists are so different from me and you? They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of a dream.
4	#	Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.
4	#	You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're saying they should have their own schools.
4	#	Yeah!
4	#	I just assume not sit next to you.
4	#	(To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing?
4	#	Uh, hey buddy.
4	#	It all right if I keep these here for a while? I'm having a New Year's Eve party.
4	#	No, Jerry. New Year's Eve nineteen ninety-nine. The millennium. I told you about that.
4	#	You're not gonna see 'em. I got a case of party poppers I'm gonna keep in front of 'em.
4	#	What, we talking hirachis? I know a great store for hirachis.
4	#	No, no. Cinqo de Mayo. (leaving) Yeah, Marcellino, he turned me on to it, and he's one sixty-fourth Mayan.
4	#	Yeah, I'm gonna keep these here too, huh? They'll be alright. (begins to leave)
4	#	(at the door) Well, those aren't for New Year's. Those are my everyday balloons.
4	#	You think people will still be using napkins in the year two-thousand? Or is this mouth-vacuum thing for real?
4	#	It's pronounced thermometer.
4	#	You know, in the year two-thousand, we'll all be on speed-dial. You'll just have to think of a person, they'll be talking to you. It'll be like, wup (judders and puts his hands to his temples, as if receiving a call on a 'mental phone') getting a call here.
4	#	(to Jerry and George) Hey, it's Newman. (to 'mental phone') Hey, how you doing, Newman?
4	#	(to 'mental phone') Oh, you wanna talk to Jerry?
4	#	So Jerry, my millennium party's really coming together. Will people be able to breathe underwater in the year two-thousand?
4	#	(crumpling a piece of paper) I don't wanna exclude anybody.
4	#	Elaine, I'm having a millennium party, so save the date.
4	#	Newman?
4	#	(reads) Come celebrate the millennium, with Newmanniun. Newman!
4	#	Well, I just got your invitation to the Newmanniun party.
4	#	(getting worked up) You knew I was having a millennium party, but you just had to throw yours on the same day!
4	#	Yeah, well you're gonna have to cancel it, because I've told everybody about my party.
4	#	(worked up) Well, what am I gonna do? I got over two hundred folding chairs, and quite a bit of ice.
4	#	Cubed.
4	#	I gotta invite Jerry. He's my buddy.
4	#	Jerry... Newman... Two-thousand...
4	#	(yells) Newmanniun!!
4	#	(whimper) Jerry?
4	#	Yeah, yeah, I know. (he clicks off the TV) Listen, Jerry, I can't let you come to my New Year's party.
4	#	(agitated) I mean, it's killing me! Newman's got the jump on the invites, and will crush me if I try to go it alone!
4	#	(swung by Jerry's argument) You're right. I won't do it without you. I feel so ashamed I even thought of it, huh.
4	#	(pleading) Elaine, you can't go to Newman's Newmanniun.
4	#	No, no, no. You gotta spend New Year's nineteen ninety-nine with me and Jerry.
4	#	(frustrated shout) Oh come on!!
4	#	(triumph) Yesss! Alright, so it's you, it's me, and it's Jerry, huh. (claps hands) Yeah, now things are starting to snowball, huh. I'll tell Newman I don't need him. So, I'll uh, see you two in the twenty-first century.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Can do.
4	#	Hi, I'm H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy American industrialist uh, looking to open a silver mine in the mountains of Peru and uh, before I invest millions in a lucrative mine, I, I'd like to go a little native. Uh, Get the feel of their condiments, of their unmentionables, you know, the real uh, gritty-gritty.
4	#	Well uh, I think I can just browse around on my own.
4	#	(re the chips) Hmm, Macchu Picchu. Are these free?
4	#	Hmm-mmm.
4	#	Oh, not a problem.
4	#	L'Occupado.
4	#	Elaine, I broke the price-gun, so I had to move to plan B.
4	#	(holds up some small white sachets) I took these out of every single garment in the store.
4	#	They're dessicates. See, they absorb moisture. (gleeful) These clothes won't last five years without 'em.
4	#	Patience.
4	#	What?
4	#	(emerging from the changing room) Well, I don't mind if I do.
4	#	Well, I've uh, I've changed my mind. I think I'm going to build a rollercoaster instead.
4	#	I don't know what Elaine is so upset about. I mean, without dessicates, those clothes'll be noticeably musty in five years.
4	#	Oh, well I guess she found some place better to go.
4	#	Well, maybe so, but come midnight, when she's looking for someone warm and cuddly to kiss, I guess you'll be caught between the moon and New York City.
4	#	Jerry too, of course.
4	#	Deal?
4	#	(grasps Newman's hand) To the Kramennium.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Hi.
4	#	Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
4	#	Well let's sit down.
4	#	Vaguely.
4	#	You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
4	#	Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.
4	#	Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.
4	#	He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.
4	#	All right, let's go.
4	#	Hey buddy. Remember me?
4	#	Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?
4	#	I'm the real Peterman.
4	#	Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat and giggley.
4	#	I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're hurting my elbow.
4	#	So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.
4	#	What's the matter with you?
4	#	No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's wrong. What is it.
4	#	What did you do?
4	#	Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down there.
4	#	(high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around the town square.
4	#	Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. You hear me?
4	#	Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.
4	#	I forgot. Wait. Never mind.
4	#	(yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry.
4	#	(yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check it out. Hahaha.
4	#	Here you go, here you go, check it out.
4	#	Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the stories behind the stories.
4	#	I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and desert.
4	#	Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman eats.
4	#	No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
4	#	Talk to me.
4	#	Understand?
4	#	Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
4	#	What are you doing to yourself?
4	#	You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and fuller and darker.
4	#	Is it? Look at this.
4	#	(high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.
4	#	Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
4	#	Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken wire.
4	#	(over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.
4	#	Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
4	#	Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time. Okay. Lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
4	#	Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and I'll only charge to 60 bucks.
4	#	All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the bus.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Yeah there are a few seats still available.
4	#	Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.
4	#	Are they war veterans?
4	#	All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour...
4	#	And go we will.
4	#	We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling muffin stumps to the local repository.
4	#	And we're off.
4	#	I was going to dump this.
4	#	Well it's muffin stumps
4	#	This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
4	#	Is this a joke?
4	#	(gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take it up with Consumer Affairs. Ladies and Gentlemen you're in for an additional treat. We're going to extend the tour at no extra charge.
4	#	(looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, no more questions.
4	#	Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
4	#	I don't know where the tops are.
4	#	Jerry what's the matter?
4	#	Hey Jerry, you got any Tums?
4	#	I drank too much water in the shower.
4	#	Oh, the Tony's. I'll see you there buddy.
4	#	Roger that.
4	#	Well, all over the place. Yeah, I'm a seat filler. They don't like to see empty seats on TV so when somebody gets up I just park my kaboos on their spot until they get back.
4	#	Mickey, Mickey he hooked me up. He's a member of the academy.
4	#	Well, he didn't say (leaves).
4	#	Are you leaving? Cause I got you covered.
4	#	I'll just squeeze in...
4	#	My job. What are you doing?
4	#	You know, if they catch two of us on TV, you got some explaining to do.
4	#	(to woman next to him) Pemmican turkey? Come on take a bite...well more for me.
4	#	Whooa, good morning gentleman and Tony says hello to you.
4	#	Jerry, it was a whirlwind. They whisked us backstage, the media is sworming, champagne is flowing...whooo! I can't describe how great it is to win.
4	#	Featuring the mind-blowing performance of Ms. Raquel Welch!
4	#	Aah, Jerry I'm not gonna let you bring me down from this high. I've been partying all night. I saw the sunrise at Liza's!
4	#	No.
4	#	(shouts to the telephone) Hi George!
4	#	So, what's George doing?
4	#	So listen, I'm going to crab a bite to eat at Sardi's. You wanna go?
4	#	The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.
4	#	I'm going.
4	#	Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I have so many people I want to thank and don't want to forget anyone...
4	#	...so I said to him Arthur, Artie come on, why does the salesman have to die? Change the title; The life of a salesman. That's what people want to see.
4	#	Hey, eh, Lew!
4	#	No.
4	#	Anything...
4	#	Oh yeah, she's fantastic....
4	#	So, you'd like me to teach how to dance?
4	#	Because they're terrified of her. I heard from someone that when they cut one of her lines, she climbed up the rope on side of the stage and started dropping lights on peoples heads. Story like that has got to be true.
4	#	Jerry, you're not in show business. You don't know what these people are like.
4	#	Oh, come on! What am I gonna do? She's going to eat me alive.
4	#	Yayaya...
4	#	Cat fight?
4	#	Yeye cat fight!
4	#	T-t-t-t...
4	#	Ms. Welch.
4	#	Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer, I'm one of the producers.
4	#	Well, I- I Ms. Welch I do need to talk to you about a little problem regarding, eh, your performance.
4	#	Well, it seems that due to the vagaries of the production parameters of this fragmenting of the audience to the cable television, carnivals, water parks...
4	#	Well, you're fired because you don't move your arms when you tap dance, you're like a gorilla out there I've gotta go...
4	#	So how's George?
4	#	Tony.
4	#	Raquel Welch!
4	#	The woman is a menace.
4	#	Yey eye ca-catfight.
4	#	Well, that's good news.
4	#	Yeah, that's weird.
4	#	I'd like to get some coffee.
4	#	You got any shredded coconut?
4	#	Yeah, yeah, right. (walks out)
4	#	Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?
4	#	D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving creams. I'm getting no protection.
4	#	Whatever you get.
4	#	Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
4	#	Oh, the face-painting auto mechanic. So she's dating him again, huh?
4	#	Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. (whistles) That guy's coming home in a body bag.
4	#	Hey, what are you doing?
4	#	Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the Internet he killed.
4	#	Jerry, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a stick of Jerry's butter across his face) You're just being totally ridiculous. (keeps rubbing) I'll see you later buddy.
4	#	What?
4	#	I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything else, Mr. Nosy?
4	#	I'm shaving with it.
4	#	Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. The shave is close and clean, and the natural emolients keep my skin silky-smooth. Now feel my face.
4	#	Feel it.
4	#	Feel it. Feel it.
4	#	Hey! They hooked me up.
4	#	I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?
4	#	No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my body.
4	#	Oh, man. I think I cooked myself.
4	#	Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.
4	#	I'm fried.
4	#	Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.
4	#	No, I read an article in Bon Appetit magazine. (grabs a baster) I'll see you later.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	How you doing? (Kramer leaves)
4	#	Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
4	#	Yeah, it's baked on in. Hey, put another stick of butter in.
4	#	Yeah, stir it up so it melts.
4	#	Oh yea that feels good. Ahh, now I'm simmering.
4	#	Jerry, what are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw your set?
4	#	Whoa, man!
4	#	Oh, tough crowd.
4	#	Well, that wasn't so bad, huh?
4	#	No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? I mean, it was edgy, it was not my sort of thing but some of those people out there, they really liked it.
4	#	Well, that guy who yelled out.
4	#	And laughter is the best medicine.
4	#	Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big turkey out there.
4	#	A big fat turkey.
4	#	I tell ya, he worked so hard and then he just--
4	#	What is this, oregano?
4	#	Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and it's sticking to me because of the butter! Look at me!
4	#	What is this, parsley?
4	#	Ah you bit me. Get off of me, get off of me!
4	#	Hello!
4	#	(doing the voice) La la la.
4	#	Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.
4	#	Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.
4	#	You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?
4	#	(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?
4	#	Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!
4	#	Hoochie moochie. (haha)
4	#	(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!
4	#	So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.
4	#	Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.
4	#	Hes a go getter!
4	#	My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.
4	#	Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.
4	#	Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.
4	#	Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
4	#	You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.
4	#	(smiles) yeah.
4	#	Yeah, 5.
4	#	What? When did this happen?
4	#	(yelling) DARREN!
4	#	Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")
4	#	Uh huh
4	#	Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.
4	#	Yeah, well nothing before noon.
4	#	Yeah, your phone is line one.
4	#	Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.
4	#	And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.
4	#	Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.
4	#	I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?
4	#	I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.
4	#	Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.
4	#	So played.
4	#	Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.
4	#	Kramerica is no more.
4	#	Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.
4	#	Well, youre still here?
4	#	Well, I havent changed my mind.
4	#	Well, you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica industries lives! Lets get back to work!
4	#	Lets see what Jerry has to eat.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.
4	#	No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.
4	#	Conceivably.
4	#	Did you bring the video camera?
4	#	You gave up the voice?
4	#	Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.
4	#	Bombs away (Uh oh).
4	#	Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Darren is going away for a long long time.
4	#	(doing the voice) La la la.
4	#	Hey.
4	#	(Laughing) What is that, a new bit?
4	#	I'll do it.
4	#	Yeah, I love going to the country.
4	#	(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.
4	#	It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.
4	#	Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.
4	#	(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
4	#	(Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor.
4	#	Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.
4	#	(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.
4	#	Hey, buddy!
4	#	(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...
4	#	She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?
4	#	Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.
4	#	Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)
4	#	(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!
4	#	Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?
4	#	I love you, too, buddy, and George--
4	#	Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.
4	#	I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'
4	#	On the signal, George. On the signal.
4	#	Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!
4	#	Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.
4	#	Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.
4	#	(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!
4	#	Serenity! (He exits)
4	#	Serenity now, serenity now...
4	#	Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.
4	#	Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.
4	#	(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!
4	#	(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!
4	#	(Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww!
4	#	(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.
4	#	Hey, Seinfelds!
4	#	How long are you staying?
4	#	Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...
4	#	No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.
4	#	Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.
4	#	Done.
4	#	My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.
4	#	Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!
4	#	Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.
4	#	I closed down my account at the blood bank.
4	#	Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?
4	#	You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.
4	#	What the heck is going on here?
4	#	Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.
4	#	For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.
4	#	Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.
4	#	Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.
4	#	Don't take my money!
4	#	No, I'm the baby-sitter.
4	#	There was an incident.
4	#	Would you stop it.
4	#	It's Jell-O.
4	#	This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)
4	#	Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.
4	#	Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.
4	#	Heads up!
4	#	It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.
4	#	That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.
4	#	Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.
4	#	Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.
4	#	Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave it for me, huh?
4	#	Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.
4	#	What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...
4	#	So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
4	#	No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?
4	#	Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, is it all right if I watch a tape in here?
4	#	Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.
4	#	Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed is really nice?
4	#	Ok!
4	#	Blood!
4	#	We're making sausages.
4	#	Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.
4	#	All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.
4	#	Why did you get rid of that sausage?
4	#	Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?
4	#	I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.
4	#	All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your bed.
4	#	Oh, man...(looks to the glove compartment for a manual.) "If the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never, I can't do that.
4	#	Oh, mama...
4	#	Shees, come on...(opens the radiator)..this thing is bone dry. (Looks at the blood.)
4	#	That kid...
4	#	Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that thing.
4	#	You didn't get the blood from me.
4	#	(enters) Well... I've had it with these jackbooted thugs!
4	#	I got three 'Pottery Barn' catalogs in one day. That makes eight this month.
4	#	Oh, no. I've been saving them up here in your apartment. And now, it's payback time. 'Pottery Barn' is in for a world of hurt.
4	#	(throwing his catalogs in the Pottery Barn store) Hey, you like sending out catalogs!? How do you like gettin' 'em back!?
4	#	(entering Jerry's apartment) Will you look at this? More catalogs! 'Omaha Steaks', 'Mac Warehouse', 'Newsweek'?! I can't stop all these companies, so, I'm gonna attack this problem at the choke point.
4	#	That's... even better!
4	#	(showing Jerry his mailbox) Check it out. Rain and sleet may not stop them, but let's see them get by... these bricks.
4	#	Jerry, the whole building is brick.
4	#	A dealer? Are you insane? No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.
4	#	Come on, Jerry, just let me help you.
4	#	All right! OK! Right, here we go. Yeah. OK, so... 'For sale. A big, juicy van.' And, ooh, you gotta put down, 'interesting trades considered.'
4	#	No, you don't have to. It's all about tickling their buying bone.
4	#	Oh, that's it. They have gone too far. They keep pushing me, and pushing me. Now I got no choice but to go down there... and talk to them.
4	#	Yeah, I'd like to cancel my mail.
4	#	Oh, no, no. I don't think you get me. I want out, permanently.
4	#	Oh, yes, I am.
4	#	The bank can pay 'em.
4	#	E-mail, telephones, fax machines. Fedex, telex, telegrams, holograms.
4	#	Oh, yeah. As long as I stop getting mail!
4	#	(rushing into Jerry's apartment) Yeah, I called about the van.
4	#	(inspecting Jerry's van) So, how come you're selling it?
4	#	How many miles?
4	#	City or highway?
4	#	(breaking the antenna) Hey, hey. Take it easy. I'm not gonna be pressured. I'll walk away right now. Is this thing bent? I'm not paying for that.
4	#	All right, look. I'm going to be honest. I'm very interested in the van.
4	#	(pointing to the newspaper ad) Well, I don't really have any money. But it says right here, 'interesting trades considered'.
4	#	(pulling out an undershirt) And I'm glad I did. Here.
4	#	No, I want to trade you screen legend Anthony Quinn's undershirt. He took this off to do sit-ups in the park and I nabbed it.
4	#	Well, it's my final offer.
4	#	(handing out anti-mail pamphlets) Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on. Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
4	#	Because we're blind to their tyranny.
4	#	Yeah. Move along, Betty.
4	#	Well, not anymore. He traded it to me for some Hollywood memorabilia.
4	#	What?
4	#	Yeah, nice to meet you.
4	#	(entering Monk's) Hey, you guys.
4	#	Oh, it's fantastic. We were out in front of the post office today, and not one person went in.
4	#	Huh? Well, it symbolizes our persecution.
4	#	Oh, well. I, uh, thought we made a deal for Quinn's t-shirt.
4	#	No, I can't, I can't. See, I told Frank he could borrow it. Yeah, he wants to move some of George's stuff into storage.
4	#	Oh, listen, Jerry. One of your friends came by and he was very upset that I had your wheels.
4	#	Well, I didn't catch his name, but then he went running into the park.
4	#	(seeing Newman pull up along side him in his truck) Hey.
4	#	I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket to something else.
4	#	What?
4	#	Are you through?
4	#	Are you through?
4	#	Oh, no, no, no. That's exactly how you said it was going down.
4	#	No. You said a mailman I know, and you're a mailman I know!
4	#	(being grabbed by the security officials) Hey!
4	#	Huh? Who are you?
4	#	Henry Atkins? The postmaster general?
4	#	Henry... can I get out of here now?
4	#	Oh?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Yeah! Ha ha.
4	#	I'm very, very sorry.
4	#	Sure do!
4	#	(seeing Newman walk into the office with a bucket on his head, escorted by a security man) Geez. Newman?
4	#	Well whats the difference -- Come on (pats him on the back) -- were like Cain and Able.
4	#	No he didnt. They were in business together it was dry wall, or somethin.
4	#	All right then, what was it?
4	#	The way I remember it, Cain, he was a successful doctor, but when he took this special formula, he became Mr. Able.
4	#	Yeah. Well I was trying to make gravel and it just (moves hands around) just didnt work out.
4	#	Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.
4	#	Aahh, this looks familiar
4	#	No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. (hits his hand on the rim) Jerry, this is the set from the old Merv Griffin Show! (he climbs into the dumpster) They must be throwing it out. This stuff belongs in the Smithsonian!
4	#	Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gould is sitting on you and the next thing - you're yesterday's trash.
4	#	No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this in. Oh, Jerry look ... Merv Griffin's cigar.
4	#	(from his apartment) Hey, Jerry! Come here a sec!
4	#	Hey! (moving a chair onto the set)
4	#	(Outstretched arms) It's the Merv Griffin set. (Claps 7 times)
4	#	Oh, you just bring it in sideways and (pop) hook it.
4	#	Yeah ... backstage.
4	#	(putting on jacket) Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not as hygienic as they appeared on TV. You take Mannix for example.
4	#	All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime. (stretches his arm out, as if hes reaching out a good-bye)
4	#	Well, Elaine Benes! Well, it's great to have you! (Elaine sits down) Boy, is it possible that youre even more beautiful than the last time I saw you?
4	#	Hm, That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you were not very happy with your toys, growing up.
4	#	Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had an
4	#	Right.
4	#	And we all know how painful that can be. (as he says this, he turns and speaks directly into the non-existent television camera. Jerry looks a bit confused.)
4	#	Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come - - (motions for Jerry to move down one seat as the new guest has arrived for her segment. Kramer gives Jerry a little push) Come on sit down. Yes.
4	#	Ju - Excuse me. Yeah we're, talking this way.
4	#	Ah, Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?
4	#	What do you mean?
4	#	(to the imaginary TV camera) Only in New York. ... ha ha
4	#	Oh! (turns on the Merv Griffin theme music) Heeeyy! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George Costanza! What a surprise!
4	#	Yeah, sit, sit, sit Weeell! (laughing, clapping)
4	#	Eyaaaya-ya-ya, I'll ask the questions. What happened?
4	#	All right, let's uh, change the subject, ah. (looking at the yellow note cards) Now, uh you and uh, Jerry dated for a while. Tell us ah ... what was that like?
4	#	That was the wrong card.
4	#	(laughs too loudly) All right, let's take a short break.
4	#	Okay ah, (checks his watch) We're back!
4	#	El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
4	#	Ah to take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry ah, what's going on with you? I understand there's a young lady in your life. mmm.
4	#	Well. Sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear, wedding bells?
4	#	Newman. (Kramer smacks Newmans arm)
4	#	What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?
4	#	Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you drugged a woman so you could take advantage of her toys? Let's pause a moment. (Newman starts the taped music) Jerry, now, what you do with your personal life is your business, but when you're on my set - you clean it up, mister!
4	#	Smile, everyone! We're back!
4	#	We've officially bottomed out, mm. Who's our next guest?
4	#	We need a new format. We should shut down and re-tool.
4	#	I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
4	#	Jerry, (claps) aaya - what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come by the set.
4	#	Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... we got Jim Fowler!
4	#	Well, I practically raised his kids.
4	#	What? Two animal acts on the same show? (turns to Jerry) What is this, amateur hour? Look, George, I'm sorry, maybe another time, all right? (drums table and exits)
4	#	Okay. A little later, we're gonna be talking with animal expert, Jim Fowler.
4	#	But first, we're talking with, Jerry. (looks down to his yellow note cards) Okay, Jerry, uh, you uh, you drugged a woman in order to play with her toy, collection. How do you feel about that?
4	#	And she doesn't know anything, about this?
4	#	Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on out, Celia!
4	#	It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Git gt gt.
4	#	George I told you we're booked!
4	#	Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.
4	#	(off camera) Are we getting this?
4	#	Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.
4	#	Ill tell ya it was a grind having to fill 10 hours a day. I'm not sure I was ready to have my own talk show set.
4	#	You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.
4	#	And to the bathroom.
4	#	Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?
4	#	Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.
4	#	You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.
4	#	You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.
4	#	Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...
4	#	I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.
4	#	Hey, our meat problems are solved.
4	#	I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.
4	#	Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.
4	#	You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.
4	#	Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.
4	#	This hallway smells like potatoes.
4	#	Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...
4	#	No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.
4	#	Well, I don't want to either.
4	#	It's just...it's no picnic.
4	#	Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.
4	#	Oh mama.
4	#	I will lose that nail.
4	#	This slicer is indomitable.
4	#	You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.
4	#	See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.
4	#	Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.
4	#	Oh, that's a prickly one.
4	#	The slicer! Elaine, let's go.
4	#	The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.
4	#	I think we are looking half a millimeter.
4	#	Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.
4	#	Well, I guess I just assumed.
4	#	Yeah, that's a hall of famer.
4	#	Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)
4	#	Oh no, I don't think so.
4	#	Well, you're not checked at on it.
4	#	Well, where the meat goes?
4	#	Where do you turn it on?
4	#	But where does the meat go?
4	#	Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.
4	#	Ok, I'll go with you.
4	#	Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.
4	#	Elaine?
4	#	Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.
4	#	Hey, what's going on?
4	#	My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!
4	#	Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)
4	#	Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.
4	#	So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.
4	#	Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?
4	#	Well, what have you been doing?
4	#	Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?
4	#	There, there's your hives.
4	#	Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.
4	#	Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.
4	#	Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.
4	#	He is just setting the record straight.
4	#	Doc, huh?
4	#	Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.
4	#	You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?
4	#	Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.
4	#	Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.
4	#	Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...
4	#	George, we got a problem.
4	#	Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.
4	#	George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?
4	#	He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...
4	#	Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...
4	#	It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.
4	#	Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.
4	#	(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.
4	#	George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.
4	#	I don't want this on my conscience.
4	#	Yeah, alright...
4	#	They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.
4	#	Well, that's weird.
4	#	Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.
4	#	So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.
4	#	Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....
4	#	Do you want more pastrami?
4	#	Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?
4	#	Oh yeah, coming up...
4	#	(Confused) What is up with you two?
4	#	(To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
4	#	(Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened to your nose?
4	#	Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the wedding? Was the bride radiant?
4	#	(Interested) Ooohh... That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and heads for the bathroom)
4	#	Oh, thank you, FDR! All right, now were even.
4	#	Alright, FDR. This wish is for all the marbles. You win, you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I get one-hundred percent anti-drop-dead protection -- Forever.
4	#	Oh, man! All right, come on. There's got to be something that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.." (FDR lifts up a cooler, and puts it on the table) What, you want my kidney? (FDR is smiling wickedly as he pulls a snowball out of the cooler) Mama!..
4	#	ah, Hello FDR. Yeah, Ill have a hot one, (pulls out some cash and slaps down a bill on the stand) everything on it.
4	#	Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star last night, and I wished, against your wish.
4	#	Alright, I'm triple-wishing! Yep!
4	#	Alright.. How do you like this? (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) Ya!
4	#	(Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away)
4	#	Come on.. Come on. Yes! (Sees a falling star) There's one! (Yelling out) I wish I don't drop dead!!
4	#	You shut up!
4	#	I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to give my your birthday wish. And now you've wasted it!
4	#	Does your girlfriend have to be here?
4	#	Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am I gonna do about FDR?
4	#	And how am I gonna do that, Toots?
4	#	(Interested) That's perfect.
4	#	(Shrugging Jerry off) Nah.
4	#	I can't. (Complaining) I'm gonna drop dead.
4	#	I'm goin' to Newman's!
4	#	(Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're gonna be late for the movie.
4	#	Anything you wish. I'll tell you a little secret about zip codes They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away)
4	#	Wish?! Newman!
4	#	Lomez, Im Leavin
4	#	Newman, wait!
4	#	Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me!
4	#	Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.
4	#	Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?
4	#	Forty-eight.
4	#	Done!
4	#	Oh, geez..
4	#	(Walking away) I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..
4	#	But you haven't seen..
4	#	Yeah.. (Heads for FDR's)
4	#	Well, why?
4	#	Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out loud, it doesn't come true.
4	#	Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.
4	#	(To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he blew out his candles, he gives me this look..
4	#	EVIL, eye.
4	#	Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's bad mojo.
4	#	Yeah!
4	#	Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto it)
4	#	Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard ... and when you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (FDR is at the cash register, pays and leaves Monks) there's my friend, FDR. I'm gonna nail him in the back of the head. It's gonna be great! (Rushes out of Monks to peg his friend with the snowball)
4	#	Oh, hey, how you doing?
4	#	Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer.
4	#	Uh, you need any help, or..?
4	#	Ah, no, no, no. I-I couldn't impose.
4	#	(quietly) Ohh (Eyeing Jerry's empty apartment) Really?
4	#	You went to the coffee shop without me? I told ya, I just wanted to hop in the shower.
4	#	Showering. How long does it take you?
4	#	(seeing Elaine come into Jerry's apartment) Ten minutes? That's kooky talk. Hey Elaine, how long do you spend in the shower?
4	#	Let me smell you.
4	#	(after delicately sniffing Elaine) Uh... that's not bad at all.
4	#	(backing off) OK.
4	#	Well, here's my shower routine. Maybe I can make some changes. Get wash cloth mittens and maybe some liquid soap, and just... -pop- focus!
4	#	(enters) Well, I just got out of a 27-minute shower. I made some good cuts, and I didn't lose anything I needed. Yeah, I think what I kept is even stronger now.
4	#	(noticing suds all over his clothes and body) Wha...? Oh, man! Geez! Look at that! I'm all lathery. Jerry, you got to show me what I'm doing wrong.
4	#	No, I mean it, man. I'm lost!
4	#	(chuckling) Oh, Jerry, you know I can't do that.
4	#	Well, that's how cats do it.
4	#	OK. Let's turn the water on now.
4	#	Come on, Jerry. How about a-a baggy swimsuit?
4	#	Well, this has all been one big tease!
4	#	(taking notes on showering men at the YMCA) Now see, that's smart. Constant motion. Wow.
4	#	Oh, yeah, yeah, I-I'm watching you, too. But this guy's really showing me something!
4	#	(walking into Jerry's apartment with a fresh black eye) You got a steak?
4	#	Ah, people in this city are crazy.
4	#	(applying the steak to his eye) Thanks, buddy. Oh... yes! Hey, you got any A1, 'cause I'm cooking a steak.
4	#	Yeah, a different one.
4	#	Jerry!
4	#	Hey, Jerry, guess where I'm calling from!
4	#	No, I'm in my shower. Well, you know, I'm trying to get out of the shower sooner, and then I ask myself, 'Why?' I mean this is where I want to be. So I got a waterproof phone, I shaved, I brushed my teeth, and now I ordered a pair of chinos from J. Crew.
4	#	I'm not! I'll see ya later, buddy.
4	#	(on the phone in the shower) Lomez, you're not listenin'. Jerry likes the naked, just some of the things she does when she's naked. Calm down, I'm on your side. Geez. Hey, hold on a second. I got a clog, I'll call ya back.
4	#	(in the shower, reading an instruction manual) Installing your Clarkman garbage disposal. Dismantle latch hasp beneath main drainage lot. Oh, come on, Clarkman.
4	#	Is, uh, David Puddy there?
4	#	Well, this is Kramer.
4	#	Um, listen, you're a mechanic. Could you help me install a garbage disposal?
4	#	No. It says 'main line'.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Oh, OK. Well, thanks, buddy.
4	#	(in the shower, on the phone with Jerry) So you broke up?
4	#	Hang on.
4	#	Oh, just cooking up a little thank you for Puddy. Hey, how do you make those radish roses?
4	#	No problem there.
4	#	Well, thank you.
4	#	Yeah. And here's to David Puddy for helping me install a much needed and much appreciated garbage disposal in my bathtub.
4	#	Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time. Yeah, I made this whole meal in there.
4	#	Mm-hmm. I prepared it as I bathed.
4	#	(Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show!
4	#	(Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work.
4	#	Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.
4	#	Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.
4	#	Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.
4	#	Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.
4	#	Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)
4	#	Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)
4	#	All right, everybody! I'm back!
4	#	Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.
4	#	Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?
4	#	Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..
4	#	Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?
4	#	(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..
4	#	Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!
4	#	Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.
4	#	No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.
4	#	What's Festivus?
4	#	Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!
4	#	Well, just tell me everything, huh?
4	#	What happened to the doll?
4	#	That musta been some kind of doll.
4	#	Is there a tree?
4	#	Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.
4	#	No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.
4	#	But it's Festivus.
4	#	You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..
4	#	Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!
4	#	What? You're siding with management?!
4	#	(Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab!
4	#	Well, Happy Festivus.
4	#	There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.
4	#	(Shocked at her ugliness, he stammers) Hello.
4	#	Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)
4	#	(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.
4	#	You've been warned.
4	#	Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!
4	#	(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!
4	#	And?
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Oh, hello.
4	#	Ah-huh.
4	#	Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.
4	#	Oh, he's a tomcat.
4	#	Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!
4	#	(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!
4	#	Uh.. that's right.
4	#	Another Festivus miracle!
4	#	Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.
4	#	Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.
4	#	Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)
4	#	It's good suspension!
4	#	Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.
4	#	Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be buying..
4	#	Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer. You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.
4	#	Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont we take this boiler out for a shakedown huh?
4	#	No, no, no, I didnt.
4	#	(Up to something) Well, its a test drive, right? I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, I need to see that itll handle my daily routine.
4	#	Just a little place I like to call, "Youll see".
4	#	Now look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car, that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks out the window) Oooh, Lets see if I can get a smile from these femininas.. (Yells out to them) Hey, Ladies! (Points to the car) Its the Saab 900! What do you think? Can I interest you in a little supplemental restraint?! (They obviously do something to offend him. Kramer reacts with a face) Geez
4	#	Well, just one more errand and we can head back.
4	#	Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?
4	#	You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.
4	#	(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.
4	#	Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the "E".
4	#	Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.
4	#	Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..
4	#	Whoop! Whoop!
4	#	No, Sir. We are down there.
4	#	All right, Im satisfied. We better get some gas.
4	#	What do you mean?
4	#	There was no plan.
4	#	What, they drove to a dealership?
4	#	You are one sick mama I like it.
4	#	Yup! Yup!
4	#	Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill get us a couple of Twix bars.
4	#	All right, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine running.
4	#	No, man! Not the gas!
4	#	Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!
4	#	Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, "Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!"
4	#	Its good to have you back, Stan.
4	#	No time!
4	#	Hey!
4	#	Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!
4	#	Well, thats a weird thing to say
4	#	Yeah, yeah. I wonder hmm.
4	#	Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! (Rick is silent) Whew! Well, I think we stopped.
4	#	Yeah, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think about it..
4	#	Hey.
4	#	You got any pliers?
4	#	Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.
4	#	Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.
4	#	Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'
4	#	Mmm... Nice wallet.
4	#	Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.
4	#	I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...
4	#	Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.
4	#	Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?
4	#	Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.
4	#	Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--
4	#	Well, yeah.
4	#	Who is it?
4	#	What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
4	#	What? What are you talking about?
4	#	No. No, he can't do that.
4	#	Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten this thing out.
4	#	Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, and the furniture.
4	#	Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?
4	#	Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, but smart as a whip.
4	#	All right.
4	#	Well, you won't regret it.
4	#	So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?
4	#	Well, why didn't you tell me about this?
4	#	Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, if he catches you, we're both out.
4	#	Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.
4	#	Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?
4	#	Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak hinge.
4	#	Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.
4	#	Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed lemur!
4	#	Well, I had some hard candy in there.
4	#	Hey, Silvio!
4	#	Huh?
4	#	Relax, Silvio.
4	#	Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Oh, lots of 'em.
4	#	No.
4	#	What about Jerry?
4	#	Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.
4	#	Yeah, something like that.
4	#	All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's yours.
4	#	Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.
4	#	All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at what your life will be like if I'm not around?
4	#	Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.
4	#	And you'll get it back.
4	#	All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.
4	#	Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when you gave it to me.
4	#	Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking about?
4	#	I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.
4	#	All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.
4	#	There you go.
4	#	Ahh....
4	#	Jerry, you forgot your purse.
4	#	Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.
4	#	All right, you're not fancy!
4	#	That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
4	#	It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation . No one can keep track of all those kids with the little orange boxes of change.
4	#	Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?
4	#	Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!
4	#	Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.
4	#	Why don't you just give up?
4	#	At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't happen it's not gonna happen. All right, we go grab some bouffe . Join us?
4	#	I think she was happy someone finally said it.
4	#	felt that the conversation was lagging.
4	#	I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your place.
4	#	hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call. and some Sally woman called said "Thanks a lot, she's quitting the business, you ruined her life.
4	#	Well that's not how she remembers it.
4	#	I thought you said she stinks
4	#	Aahh...Who's Janet?
4	#	You know what woman I always thought you looked like; Leena Horne.
4	#	And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!! this is eerie.
4	#	C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.
4	#	yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.
4	#	Well how should I have "broached the subject"
4	#	Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.
4	#	Well, I think one of us should leave.
4	#	I've made an important life decision.
4	#	Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; First with that girl whose life you destroyed and.. emm...about George dating a lady Jerry
4	#	I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's exactly what I'm going to do. I'm never gonna talk again.
4	#	What do I need to talk for.. ha!, For to blab to the neighbors about George has a new fem-Jerry friend or to tell everybody at the coffee shop ho George is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend. See now, I've done all that.....Now it's time for silence.
4	#	Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. Here watch.
4	#	Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's man love towards she-Jerry.
4	#	That's the idea.
4	#	(makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
4	#	that's right......Aye oooh!! ...Right now.
4	#	Ouch!!..........Now!!
4	#	(loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.
4	#	...All right ..Starting now......
4	#	Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.
4	#	No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.
4	#	Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.
4	#	Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)
4	#	(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?
4	#	(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?
4	#	Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.
4	#	Well, that's classified.
4	#	(from inside) OK!
4	#	(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!
4	#	It was under a spoon!
4	#	(re buzzer box) What are you doin'?
4	#	(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.
4	#	Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)
4	#	(from inside) Security issue!
4	#	(clattering inside) That wasn't me!
4	#	(from inside Jerry's apartment) OK! (door opens)
4	#	All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)
4	#	Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key)
4	#	Heh.
4	#	It's Phil's.
4	#	Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.
4	#	Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.
4	#	Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...
4	#	No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)
4	#	(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.
4	#	Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.
4	#	Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?
4	#	Hey, what's going on?
4	#	Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.
4	#	Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.
4	#	What?
4	#	(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!
4	#	You just answered your own question.
4	#	(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)
4	#	(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.
4	#	(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.
4	#	Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.
4	#	Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.
4	#	Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!
4	#	(enters) Well.
4	#	Well, grab a cigar, boys. Yeah. It's time to celebrate.
4	#	Uh, you remember my coffee table book?
4	#	That's the one. A big Hollywood so-and-so optioned it for a movie.
4	#	You remember that photo book on toy ray guns?
4	#	Independence Day?
4	#	Let's just say that I don't have to worry about working for a while. A long while.
4	#	Yeah, and you're not going to, because I'm hanging it up. Boys, I'm retiring.
4	#	From the grind. I mean, who needs it? I mean, I've accomplished everything I've set out to do.
4	#	Oh, I bought myself a little retirement gift. Gold watch.
4	#	Well, it's not really gold.
4	#	(entering the condo, and going to the fridge as if he's a neighbor) Hey, buddy. When'd you get here?
4	#	I told you I was retiring. I moved in next door.
4	#	Yeah, your, uh, folks said it was for rent, so I jumped on it.
4	#	Mmmm, that sounds great, Mom.
4	#	(immaturely) I guess.
4	#	I know, I know. Don't I look more relaxed?
4	#	All right, I'll see you guys.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	(taping Morty's glasses) Morty, what're you lookin' at?
4	#	Hmm.
4	#	(to a room) Vote for Kramer. (to a man walking by) Cosmo Kramer. I'm running for condo president. I'd like your vote. Thanks. (to an old woman) Remember, ma'am, a vote for me, is a vote for Kramer.
4	#	Gladly.
4	#	Oh, no. We're campaigning, Jerry. To rule the people, one... must walk among them.
4	#	Right. Yeah. The polls close after dinner, three o'clock. But then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of eight p.m.
4	#	(looking at the newsletter) Hey, look at that. Picture of me, huh? (reading out loud) Candidate Cosmo Kramer caught barefoot in clubhouse.
4	#	Well, I couldn't find my shoes.
4	#	Oh, yeah! Me.
4	#	All right, look. People seem to like those tip calculators, huh?
4	#	Yeah, well, how 'bout if we give one out to every member on the condo board.
4	#	Payoffs. Now we're playin' politics. All right, what do we next, Morty, huh? Wiretaps, slush funds?
4	#	Well, what about your deal, huh?
4	#	Well, don't worry about it. I know a guy.
4	#	Yeah, Bob Saccamano's father.
4	#	(having lunch with Jerry and his parents) Oh, well... I handed out all the Wizards. Polls close in one hour. Whoo hoo hoo! I think we've got this baby all sewn up, huh? Oh, uh, there was an extra one. Norman Burgerman, he won't be leavin' any tips where he is.
4	#	Congratulations, Mr. Puppet Master.
4	#	What?
4	#	(getting up to leave) Well, the people have spoken. Well, that's it for me. I'm, I'm headin' back to New York.
4	#	Hey Jerry, you got any pepper?
4	#	Yeah. (inhales some pepper then sneezes violently) See? It should sound like that, something like that.
4	#	A little wetter. See, I didn't believe it.
4	#	Yeah, we're going down to Mt. Sinai Hospital, See they hire actors to help the students practice diagnosing.
4	#	Well the better ones. Alright, let's practice retching.
4	#	Mickey, DTs.
4	#	You got any Ipecac?
4	#	No, Mickey, he swallowed twelve aspirin.
4	#	No, it's just too much.
4	#	Gonorrhea? You wanna trade?
4	#	Okay, what do you got?
4	#	Good luck with that.
4	#	Well, I got gonorrhea.
4	#	That's what they gave me.
4	#	And it's a waste of my talent. It's just a little burning. Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
4	#	See, showmanship. Maybe that's what my gonorrhea is missing.
4	#	Yes, yes I will! I'm gonna make people feel my gonorrhea, and feel the gonorrhea themselves.
4	#	Just a little burning during urination.
4	#	The haunting memories of lost love. May I? (signals to Mickey) Lights? (Mickey turns down the lights and Kramer lights a cigar) Our eyes met across the crowded hat store. I, a customer, and she a coquettish haberdasher. Oh, I pursued and she withdrew, then she pursued and I withdrew, and so we danced. I burned for her, much like the burning during urination that I would experience soon afterwards.
4	#	Gonorrhea!
4	#	Oh, thank you.
4	#	Gonorrhea? Excuse me, I think there's been a mistake, see, I had gonorrhea last week.
4	#	I don't believe this, I'm being typecast.
4	#	Well, we'll see.
4	#	(pulling a liquor bottle from his jacket pocket) Well, I guess it started about twenty years ago when I got back from Viet Nam, and this was the only friend I had left.
4	#	...I didn't say that, no.
4	#	Well, I'm sorry. I gave you gonorrhea because I thought you'd have fun with it.
4	#	Oh. Hello.
4	#	(to Mickey) You know? She's right.
4	#	You can't get it from that.
4	#	Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..
4	#	Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw. See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.
4	#	Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.
4	#	(Remembering) No, that wasn't dancing.
4	#	Oh? Who's Leo?
4	#	Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..
4	#	(To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days, huh?
4	#	(Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.
4	#	Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're gonna make it happen!
4	#	Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..
4	#	We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, we're gonna have a whole fleet!
4	#	(To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.
4	#	(Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no.
4	#	(Brainstorming) What about the homeless?
4	#	(Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.
4	#	They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!
4	#	Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.
4	#	(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.
4	#	(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.
4	#	(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.
4	#	Hey, what's he doin'?
4	#	Well, then, he's out!
4	#	(While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well, the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes a noise), he bolted.
4	#	(To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.
4	#	Hey, buddy.
4	#	I thought I heard you.
4	#	Our rickshaw?
4	#	(Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.
4	#	Rusty!
4	#	(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.
4	#	What?
4	#	Yes, that's true.
4	#	Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..
4	#	Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..
4	#	(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)
4	#	(Stretching) Oh..
4	#	Woah! Wait!
4	#	Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution tape. Look at that.
4	#	Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.
4	#	Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.
4	#	They want to know why they never see you.
4	#	I'm gonna eat that later.
4	#	Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.
4	#	Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.
4	#	Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal dissension about the name.
4	#	Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.
4	#	Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
4	#	Well, more bad news Jerry.
4	#	You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
4	#	Not as many as there used to be.
4	#	You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can do this.
4	#	Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't even get along.
4	#	Oh, he's the best...and the worst.
4	#	Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.
4	#	Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's one of the things that we argue about.
4	#	Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.
4	#	Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.
4	#	Lock and load.
4	#	All right, all right, come on, now.
4	#	Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.
4	#	You weren't even married yet.
4	#	Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.
4	#	George, I thought that was the door.
4	#	Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?
4	#	Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake.
4	#	No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. Yeah.
4	#	Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, they got their own case at the end of the aisle.
4	#	George, they closed up.
4	#	The pharmacy's still open.
4	#	Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!
4	#	Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's movin' away.
4	#	Jerry, where have you been?
4	#	Downtown.
4	#	Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance relationships.
4	#	I don't know.
4	#	Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's a 646.
4	#	Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later and pick up a fax.
4	#	No. At your apartment.
4	#	Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is why you should get a fax and a Xerox.
4	#	You just blew my mind.
4	#	Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.
4	#	Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the menus from some restaurants.
4	#	Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.
4	#	Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should I pick those up later?
4	#	Ah!
4	#	Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?
4	#	Well, why no T-bone?!
4	#	Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?
4	#	Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah.
4	#	Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?
4	#	No, no, no. I looked.
4	#	Thanks, buddy.
4	#	Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What happened to Cindy?
4	#	Oh.
4	#	Well, what's the matter?
4	#	Uh-oh. You're a john.
4	#	Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.
4	#	Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.
4	#	Well, now I can't see Jerry.
4	#	What?
4	#	Come on. What'd he say?
4	#	Jerry, come on. What'd you say?
4	#	Come on. Where'd you go?
4	#	Eh! Come on. What did you say?
4	#	Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh.
4	#	Who's that?
4	#	Newman died?
4	#	All right, who's down there?
4	#	Hey, Elaine.
4	#	Did you hear about Newman?
4	#	Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't realize it, but I'm a needy person.
4	#	Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never be like you!
4	#	Hey, buddy, don't say no!
4	#	I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta move, or it's over."
4	#	I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. I don't recognize anybody. I miss home, and I don't even know how to get there.
4	#	I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
4	#	No. It's Original Ray's.
4	#	It's just Original, Jerry!
4	#	Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe.
4	#	Aah!
4	#	Uh, no.
4	#	Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I don't know where he is.
4	#	Uh, no.
4	#	Ok.
4	#	Yeah, yeah.
4	#	Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats.
4	#	You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
4	#	Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.
4	#	Oh, boy.
4	#	I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! Jerry! Go--ahh...
4	#	You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.
4	#	Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.
4	#	Yeah.
4	#	Why are we slowing down?
4	#	All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
4	#	Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.
4	#	Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.
4	#	All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can get out over there.
4	#	You know, you should make yourself throw up.
4	#	You know you're going to.
4	#	Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? None other than Miss Chita Rivera.
4	#	No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.
4	#	Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
4	#	Con dios? Well, that's rude.
4	#	You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that big in a while.
4	#	You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number off the engine block, and we walk away.
4	#	You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, and then you get another one free.
4	#	All right, what is your deductible?
4	#	Yes, because they've already deducted it.
4	#	The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.
4	#	All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.
4	#	Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.
4	#	You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.
4	#	Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can get out now.
4	#	Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!
4	#	Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
4	#	You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.
4	#	Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment.
4	#	Ok.
4	#	Oh. Delicious to meet you.
4	#	Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?
4	#	Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall grotto?
4	#	How about a bathroom?
4	#	Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?
4	#	Oh, thank you.
4	#	Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!
4	#	Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.
4	#	Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling like this only happens once a year.
4	#	Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
4	#	See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?
4	#	Ooh! !Dios mio!
4	#	Oh, no.
4	#	It was an accident.
4	#	Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!
4	#	Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.
4	#	Uh, Varnsen.
4	#	Vandelay.
4	#	The factory?
4	#	Jerry, that's in Sweden.
4	#	Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.
4	#	Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, shall we go home?
4	#	Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.
4	#	This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.
4	#	Hey! JoJo!
4	#	No, thank you. So what are you doing?
4	#	Come on, let's go to the beach.
4	#	What? It's a beautiful day.
4	#	Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the air.
4	#	Yeah, there's something in the air.
4	#	Oh hey!
4	#	Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas
4	#	You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.
4	#	You're moving to California?
4	#	Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back.
4	#	Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a virgin, she's a whore.
4	#	Fling!
4	#	I say Japan.
4	#	Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.
4	#	Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?
4	#	Oh yeah - oui oui.
4	#	The only way to fly.
4	#	Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
4	#	I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.
4	#	I lost my balance.
4	#	It was an accident.
4	#	I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
4	#	We're straightening out!
4	#	I want to capture this.
4	#	All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.
4	#	What?
4	#	The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
4	#	Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?
4	#	I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
4	#	This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last.
4	#	I bet.
4	#	How bout me, Jackie?
4	#	Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.
4	#	Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?
4	#	I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
4	#	Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.
4	#	I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
