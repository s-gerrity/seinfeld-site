1	#	I'm in the middle of a story.
1	#	Well its not like it's a really funny story or anything.
1	#	Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and then for some reason, I launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.
1	#	Yes, it was.
1	#	I know it was stupid.
1	#	Hey, I just said it was stupid.
1	#	Take it.
1	#	Hey, would you stop it already?
1	#	I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.
1	#	Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical therapist. There's a big difference. She uses the ultrasound, it's a real medical procedure. In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by insurance.
2	#	I can't get a massage from a man.
2	#	What, are you crazy? I can't have a man touching me. Switch with me.
2	#	What's the difference, you're a woman. They're supposed to be touching you.
2	#	He'd just be touching your back too.
2	#	I know. That's the point. If it's gonna get sexual, it should get sexual with you.
2	#	I would? What if something happens?
2	#	What if it felt good?
2	#	I don't want it to feel good.
2	#	Exactly!
2	#	Yes?
3	#	I have a good masseuse you could go to.
3	#	So where do you get this note?
3	#	What's the name of this physical therapist?
3	#	Right.
3	#	Why not?
3	#	No, I don't want the man either.
3	#	He'd just be touching your back.
3	#	No, it could get sexual.
3	#	I wouldn't be comfortable.
3	#	What could happen?
4	#	How can you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids, and a lot of other stuff. Oh, yyyeeah.
4	#	Man, Ughhhh, wwwheh. I just came from Roy's. I threw up from the gas.
4	#	No no, he's fine.
4	#	Where?
4	#	Yeah -- yeah.
4	#	Wait, wait hold on now, wait, wait *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table, startling 1, 3 and 2) *bang* (again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip* *yip* See? I told you.
4	#	I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited
4	#	No, blame me.
4	#	Don't blame me.
4	#	It was supposed to erupt.
