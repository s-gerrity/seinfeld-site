## The Ultimate Seinfeld Experience

### Overview

The Ultimate Seinfeld Experience is a fan site where visitors can chat with different character bots, access a live countdown to the shows' holiday 'Festivus', view recent Tweets from some of the actors, and search for restaurants nearby according to food categories referenced on the program.

### Technologies required

- Twitter API, Yelp API, Google Maps API, Tweepy, Arrow, Bootstrap, Flask, Jinja, PostgreSQL, JQuery

### Data

- Bot character options, food categories for local restaurant search, and quotes for bot responses

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- Visitors choose from 4 characters to chat with. Give input and receive a response (quote from the show).

- Festivus holiday countdown show days until the holiday. 

#### 2.0

#### 3.0
